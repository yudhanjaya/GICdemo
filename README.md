# GICdemo

This is a simple prototype showing an easier-to-user government information center (GIC, Sri Lanka) using a new AI-assited content review policy and RAG search on top. 

It distills the procedures of various government instutes into simple guides. As befits a demo, it's a simple HTML file that access a bunch of markdown locally.
