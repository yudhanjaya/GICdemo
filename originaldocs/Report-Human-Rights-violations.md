Human Rights Bureau

This bureau was set up in the year 2005 under the directions of the Hon.

Chairman of the Legal Aid Commission with the mandate to promote fundamental

right litigation. The functions of the Bureau were further expanded with the

introduction of the ICCPR Act and now, it is contemplating initiating actions

under the ICCPR Act.� In addition the Bureau is engaged in the following

activities;

 * Provide Human Rights counseling

 * Conduct awareness programmes for Police Officers

 * Publish materials on human rights

 * Organize legal aid clinics

 * Co-ordinate with Institutions involved in human rights activities

The main significance of the Bureau lies in the fact that the Supreme Court

Rules specifically recognizes the Legal Aid Commission as an Institution to

refer allegations of fundamental rights violations received by the Supreme Court

Registry. Once a reference is made, it becomes the responsibility of the

Commission to take necessary steps to proceed with the case. The Commission

entered in to an MOU with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka and

coordinated with the Human Rights Commission to promote human right litigation.

Staff

At present there is one permanent legal officer, Uma Wijesinghe, in charge of

the bureau.
