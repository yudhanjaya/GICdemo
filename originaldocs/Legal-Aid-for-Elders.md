Elders Desk

Nearly 2.3 million of Sri Lanka’s population is senior citizens who have

surpassed 60 years of age. This number constitutes about 1/5 of the total voting

population of Sri Lanka. The elderly who have gained wide knowledge and immense

experience is the greatest resource of a country. It can be used wisely towards

the development of the country.To visit the internally displaced persons in

their camps.

Protection of Rights of Elders,’ Act No.9 of 2000 enacted with all party support

was the first attempt to recognize the challenges forced by senior citizens. The

Law however, established the National Council of Elders to organize over 6500

village elders societies and provide them with service resources to develop self

employment programs. Village based elders societies could be considered a

success as they have generated programs on their own. However, organization of

elder’s societies has to be restructured so that the wealth, experience and

talent lying unused with elders are harnessed for the development of our

country. As elders respect human values more than the globalized middle aged

people, they should be harnessed as teachers in pre-schools like in many other

countries.

The Elders’ Desk of the Legal Aid Commission was set up mainly for the following

purposes:-

 * To provide free legal advice regarding maintenance, accident claims, loss of

 property, pension and fundamental rights of destitute elders.

 * To lead counseling service centering ‘Elders’ Homes’ and ‘Day Centers’ in

 view of educating Grama Niladharies, Social Service Officers and school

 children on elders’ rights and elders, law.

 * To launch joint programs in collaboration with the National Secretariat for

 elders and the People's Bank.

 * To help win the rights guaranteed to elders under the Protection of Elders

 Rights Act No.9 of 2000.

The Head of the Elders’ Desk is Piyumi Kumari, Attorney-at-Law who coordinates

with the National Secretariat for Elders and conduct awareness programs. She is

also responsible for advising destitute elders regarding their rights who are

subjected to abuse and violence purely due to their old age.

Please follow the Common Procedure
