Stabalisation of prices of Essential Commodities

The Consumer Affairs Authority takes measures to stabilize the prices of

essential (Specified) commodities at reasonable levels, by provisions granted in

Sections 14, 18 and 19 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No.9 of 2003. Where

an item is specified as an essential commodity under Section 18 of the Act, an

importer, manufacturer or trader has to obtain the prior written approval of the

Authority before increasing the price of such item. Acting under Section 19 of

the Act, the Authority can intervene in situations of “excessive pricing” and

determine a Maximum Retail Price for such commodity. Section 14 of the Act

facilitates agreements on prices with manufacturers and traders.

Goods or services specified under Section 18 (1) of the Act will be published in

the Gazette of the Government of Sri Lanka.

The items that are gazetted as specified items under Section 18 are:

1. Milk Powder - Full Cream

2. LPG

3. Wheat Flour

4. Cement

5. Chicken Meat

6. White Sugar

7. Dried Chilies

8. Big Onions

9. Red Onions

10. Dhal

11. Dried Sprats

12. Gram

13. Green Moong

14. Rice

15. Canned Fish

Once a product or service is specified as an specified commodity under Section

18(1) of the Act, sections 18(2) and 18(3) require a manufacturer or trader

marketing such commodity or service to obtain the prior written approval of the

Authority before increasing the price. Section 18(4) of the Act requires the

Authority to give its decision within 30 days of the submission of a proper

application, unless the applicant company has not provided the required

assistance to the Authority to conduct a proper examination of the application,

in which event the Authority is empowered to issue an “Interim Order”

prohibiting the company from increasing the price until a decision is made.
