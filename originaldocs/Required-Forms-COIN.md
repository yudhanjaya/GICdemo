Financial Service to the Construction Contractors who possess valid National

Registration developed by the Institute for Construction Training & Development

(ICTAD)

For several decades, Construction Contractors, particularly the small and medium

scale Contractors were faced with a dilemma in complying with the regulations

that require them to furnish Bonds and Guarantees for the purpose of Bidding and

Executing Construction Contracts for both the State and Private Sector

Organizations. Such a scenario was caused as Commercial Banks demand large cash

margins or immovable property as Security/Collateral for providing the

Construction Contractors with bonding facilities. Such margins or collateral

ranged from 100-200% of the Bond value.

On representations made by the Industry in this regard, the Government in 1999

decided to set-up a Government Funded Organization to provide the required

facilities to Construction Contractors against reasonable conditions. For this

purpose Government allocated a grant of Rs.100.0 Million from the Budget. The

secretary to the Treasury was entrusted to implement the proposal to established

a trust and accordingly the declaration of trust was entered between the

Secretary to the Treasury as settlor and bestowed powers to a Board of Trustees

comprised from Government & Private sector for the proper execution and the

Management of the Trust/Fund.

It was in this context that the Construction Guarantee Trust/Fund (CGF) was

established in 1999 as an Independent Trust with autonomy. Accordingly, the

Trust/Fund is presently administered by a Board of Trustees represented from the

Government and Private Sectors, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary to the

Ministry incharge of the subject of construction.

The main objective of the Trust/Fund is to provide Bonds & Guarantees to

Construction Contractors for them to provide Bonds & Guarantees and such other

securities when Bidding & undertaking Construction Contracts and matters

connected theirwith.

In order to obtain such securities the Construction Contractors who possess a

valid Registration under the National Registration Scheme developed by Institute

of Construction Training And Development (ICTAD).
