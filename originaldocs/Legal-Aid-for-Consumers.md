Consumer Protection Desk

The consumer protection activities have now emerged as a major public services

component in the society. With the enactment of the Consumer Affairs Law No.9 of

2003 and the appointment of the Consumer Affairs Authority, the general

awareness of the consumer rights has become important for the benefit of the

general public.

The UN principles on consumer protection form the basis of the consumer law in

Sri Lanka whereby not only the consumers but also the integrity of

manufacturers, traders and service providers are also protected.

The Consumer Protection Desk of the Legal Aid Commission liaises closely with

the Consumer Affairs Authority and conduct awareness programs through the 34

Legal Aid Centers islandwide. The target groups for the awareness programs are

6,500 Elders’ Societies, 14,200 Grama Niladharies and 100 Law Circles in schools

in different provinces.

The Head of the Consumer Protection Desk is Lasanthi Palapaththwela,

Attorney-at-Law who coordinates with the Consumer Affairs Authority and conduct

awareness programs. She is also responsible for advising consumers who are

victimized by traders in violation of the Consumer Affairs Law and seek redress

from the Authority.

Please follow the Common Procedure
