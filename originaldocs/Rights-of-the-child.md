Taking measures to promote the Rights of the child

Sri Lanka has ratified the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the

child in 1991. Hence, this Department is entrusted with the responsibility of

implementing the articles as given in this convention for the welfare of

children in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the Department has been implementing a few

programmes identified, so as to promote the Rights of the Child.

1. Conducting awareness programmes for the public to ensure the Rights of the

child (these programmes are conducted at Divisional Secretariat level by Child

Rights Promotion Officers attached to Divisional Secretariats throughout the

Island.

2. Strengthening and maintaining the Network of Monitoring Committees

established to ensure the Rights of the Child. (Divisional ,District and

National Level)

3. Implementation of varied programmes to establish and ensure the Rights of the

child for education, health, shelter and protection.

Further particulars related to these programmes could be obtained from the Child

Rights Promotion Officer, attached to the Divisional Secretariat concerned.
