Off-shore Sand Pumping & Selling

Due to the recent growth in the construction industry,�

the demand for fine aggregates is escalating

rapidly. River sand has been the most widely used fine

aggregates in Sri Lanka and over-exploitation of

river sand to meet the demand has led to various harmful

consequences such as increase in the depth of

the river bed, lowering of the water table, and

salinity intrusion into the rivers. Because of these

environmental problems, there is a necessity to restrict

river sand mining especially at vulnerable

locations. As a remedial measure, the government imposes

various restrictions on the extraction of river

sand with consequent increases in prices. Not only has

this inconvenienced the users directly, but also

indirectly impacted on the overall stability of the

construction industry owing to concomitant increases in

construction prices.

A pilot survey revealed that individuals and state sector

clients seldom approve the use of shore sand or

offshore sand for concrete let alone reinforced concrete.

Further, the initial offshore sand stockpile lying in

Muthurajawela is exhausted and fresh offshore stockpiles

are being formed, but they require exposure to

rain. Therefore, further studies are required looking

into the suitability of offshore sand from different

perspectives. Since the potential environmental

damage due to offshore sand extraction is far less

compared to that due to river sand extraction.

As a result of these restrictions, obtaining sand at the

required quantities at required times, is a major

problem for those engaged in the construction industry.

As a solution to this problem our corporation has

launched a project to release offshore sand to the market

with the reasonable price and as a service of protection

of envirenment and sustainability of construction industry.
