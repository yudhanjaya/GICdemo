Scientific Standardization Division

Vision :

"To promote standardization and quality control in industry and commerce while ;

uplifting the quality of life of the nation with standards in all sectors of the

economy considering the national and international requirements & demand and

enhancing relationships with all stakeholders in standardization"

Mission :

 * Formulate standards on national and International basis relating to

 structures, commodities, products, materials, practices, and operations

 * Revise, alter and amend the same for the current use.

 * Promote the adoption of such standards

 * Promotion of standards within the community and

 * Remove the trade barrier with harmonization of standards

Quality policy

The Standardization Division is committed to;

Perform its activities to the best of its ability to achieve the corporate goals

of the Institution in formulation of National standards in line with the

International standards

Achieve socio-economic development and enhance International competitiveness of

products and services and safeguard the interest of consumers whilst developing

the competence of staff of the Standardization Division paving the way to

improve the functions of the Division on continual basis.

The Scientific Standardization Division is entrusted with development of

National Standards for products and services to be used mainly in the industrial

and trade sector. The division is consisted of three sections namely Agriculture

and Food, Chemical and Cosmetic as well as Textile and Garments to facilitate

development of standards in multidisciplinary manner addressing different

categories.

Development of national standards may vary as Specifications for materials or

products; they may be Code of Practices or guides giving recommended practices

in same field of industry or may be Methods of Test or Glossaries of Terms. Also

whenever feasible, as a policy, Scientific Standardization Division adopts and

refers to International Standards such as ISO and ASTM to make the national

standards inline with international requirements

Sri Lanka Standards are developed through Committees and as cooperative effort;

by negotiations and consensus of all interested parties are concerned. This

achieves through consultation of various expert groups representing

manufacturers, consumers/users, Academia, research organizations, Public

Institutions and Independent Technical Organizations.

The Scientific Standardization Division appoints technical committees called

Sectoral Committees to advice and guides these standard formulation activities

and these committees are managed by professionally qualified staff of the Sri

Lanka Standards Institution who provides secretarial and technical assistance on

matters pertaining to principles and procedures of standardization. The

Scientific Standardization Division plays the role of a coordinating body

whereby knowledge and experience available in the country to direct to the

preparation of standards.

In the selection of standard formulation projects, priority is given to

standards that facilitate internal and external trade and to enhance the

international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products with the prime objective of

safeguarding the interest of the consumers and the industry.

Currently there are over 1350 Sri Lanka Standards relating to products,

materials, processes and practices. Many standards have been revised to entrust

of new development of materials, processes and technologies.

Sri Lanka Standards are intended for voluntary adoption by those concerned

unless made compulsory by Acts and Regulations.

The Scientific Standardization Division has been awarded ISO 9001: 2008 Quality

Management System Certification by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in 2009

which is an indication of rigorous quality of standards formulation

ENGINEERING STANDARDS FORMULATION DIVISION

The National Engineering Standards formulated by the Engineering Standardization

Division are developed through a committee process and a consultative process

with the voluntary involvement and the co-operative effort of all interested

parties representing consumers, producers, users, public Institutions and

independent technical Organizations.

The Institution appoints Technical Committees to advice and guide the

Institution in these activities, with the aim of gathering all possible

expertise in the best possible way to maximize benefits to the national economy

from these Standardization activities.

National standards represent co-ordinated solutions for use in technology,

commerce trade and administration and are intended to achieve;

 * overall economy in terms of human effort materials, power and other resources

 in the exchange of goods and services.

 * the protection of consumer interest through adequate and consistent quality

 of goods and services.

 * safety, health and protection of life, and;

 * provide a means of expression and of communication amongst all interested

 parties.

These standards may be specifications for materials or products; they may be

codes of practice written in mandatory form or guides giving recommended

practices in some field of industry; or they many be methods of test, glossaries

of terms or may express some other form of standardization.

In the formulation of Standards, the policy of the Sri Lanka Standards

Institution is to be in line with the International Standards and practices as

far as practicable. To this effect International Standards are adopted, as Sri

Lanka Standards, wherever feasible.

In the selection of Standards formulation projects priority is given to

standards that facilitate internal and external trade and to enhance the

international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products with the prime objective of

safeguarding the interest of the consumer.

There are now around 1400 Sri Lanka Standards relating to products, commodities,

materials, processes & practices. Many have been revised to take care of the

developments in the new materials, processes and technologies. Such revisions

are indicated with the year of revision. Sri Lanka Standards are intended for

voluntary adoption by those concerned unless made compulsory under the

provisions of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution Act or by specific reference

to standards in other acts and regulations.

SECTORAL COMMITTEES

The Council of the SLSI appoints Sectoral Committees covering broad subject

areas to advise the SLSI on standards formulation

nominated from respective organizations as well as members appointed on a

personal capacity.

SLSI in consultation with Sectoral Committees may appoint Working Groups to deal

with specific standardization projects. Such Working Groups report to the

relevant Sectoral Committee.

Chairpersons of the Sectoral Committees are appointed by the Council of the

SLSI. These committees meet about once in two months or more often as necessary.

Meetings of a committee are normally open only to members of the committee.

Requests for attendance by visitors for special purposes should be directed in

the first instance to SLSI which will issue and invitation in consultation with

the Chairman of the Sectoral Committee.

Each standardization project is managed by a Standards Engineer of the

Engineering Standerdization Division of the SLSI. There are several alternate

procedures which are adopted based on the nature and complexity of the subject;

availability of data, reference documents, other relevant standards, and

information. The alternative procedures which are followed are indicated in a

flow chart ![/gic/pdf/flow chart.pdf](/gic/pdf/flow chart.pdf).
