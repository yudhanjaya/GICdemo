Migrant Workers Desk

Sri Lankan workers who migrate to Middle East and other countries have become

victims of various difficulties, both in Sri Lanka and overseas, due to lack of

knowledge of the basic labour laws of their own country as well as the host

country. The situation is compounded by absence of accessible legal aid for

these workers before departure and upon return.

Currently expatriate workers send over Rs.300,000 Million in 2008as foreign

exchange and it is the responsibility of the State and civil society to provide

necessary legal protection to migrant workers, specially the females. The Legal

Aid Commission of Sri Lanka has considered the gravity and the urgency of the

situation, and decided to set up a Migrant Workers’ Desk. The main objectives of

this Desk is –

 * Provide free legal aid assistance to migrant workers prior to departure,

 during their stay abroad and upon return.

 * To brief the departing migrant about the legal conditions in the countries of

 destinations and what actions they could take in the case if violation of

 rights.

 * To liaise with the Consular Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and

 the Foreign Employment Bureau.

 * To promote the rights under the 1990 UN Convention on Migrant Workers at the

 village level.

 * Counseling.

The Migrant Workers Desk is headed by T.M.Lilanthi Kumari, Attorney-at-Law who

has conducted several awareness programs relating to migrant workers in order to

safeguard their safety, rights and interests.

LAC is hoping to set up a Legal Aid Branch at the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment

Bureau in order to assist the poor migrant workers more effectively and to avoid

inordinate delays.

Please follow the Common Procedure
