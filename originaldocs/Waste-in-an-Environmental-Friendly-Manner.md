Cooperate E- waste Management Programme – “Ensuring an E waste free environment”

Central Environmental Authority

Electronic Waste or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) describes

as discarded, obsolete, or broken electrical or electronic devices.

People in developing countries usually go for low priced electric and electronic

equipments due to the unavailability of financial resources. Most of demands in

these equipment markets are being quenched by the importation of used equipments

from developed countries.

The most critical issue is that a considerable share of these imported e items

are not in working condition and have to be disposed at the imported

destinations. Due to lack of proper waste management practices in these

developing countries hap hazard dumping of these e waste has become a common

practice leading to adverse impacts on human health and the environment.

However during the 6th meeting of the Conference to the parties to the Basel

Convention (BC) for the Transboundary Movement of the Hazardous Waste, E- Waste

was considered as one of the main streams of wastes to be managed properly due

to the fact that there are increasing quantities of E-wastes being exported from

developed countries to developing countries, where there is inadequate capacity

to manage them in an environmentally sound manner.

Toxic substances in electronic waste may include lead, mercury, cadmium,

Polyclorinated Biphenyles, Brominated Flame Retardants. A typical computer

monitor may contain more than 6% lead by weight, much of which is in the lead

glass of the CRT. These toxic substances can be bio-accumulating in fatty

tissues and biomagnifying up to food chains in combination with their toxicity

and persistence make this class of chemicals of high concern to the environment

and human health..

How to collect electronic waste?

Central Environmental Authority (CEA) in collaboration with the other

stakeholder companies has been initiated a programme to collect and all

discarded electronic items in introducing e waste collection points island wide

as below.
