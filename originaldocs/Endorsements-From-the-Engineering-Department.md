dmsmos@sltnet.lk  Other Information Computation of Sea Service (1) The

qualifying seagoing service specified for officers and ratings for any

particular certificate of competency or endorsement shall be performed within a

period of ten years preceding the date of commencement of the assessment of

competency and shall include a period of 12 months sea service within the five

years preceding the date of commencement of assessment of competency (2) service

non trading vessels, tugs, dredgers, research vessels engaged in similar

activities may be counted in full, if the time actually spent at sea constitutes

or exceeds two-third of the total period of service on-board ship. if the actual

sea going service falls below this proportion, one and a half times the actual

sea going service may be counted as “qualifying seagoing service”. Candidates

shall be required to produce, in addition to the evidence of sea service

required of all candidates, a statement or certificate from the company and the

master of the ships, setting out the amount of time actually spent at sea, with

particular reference to at least six months watch keeping service under

supervision (3) Where such service has been performed only on particular types

of vessels specified in paragraph 2, their certificates may be restricted for

service on such vessels only (4) Officers of the Sri Lanka Navy of the executive

officer branch and marine engineering branch who intend to become holders of

Certificates of Competency for near coastal voyages complying the requirements

of the convention shall be required to complete approved relevant education,

training, examination and assessment. Such candidates, existing experience,

qualifications and certificates if any, shall form the basis for determining

qualifying merchant ship sea going service, training and assessment as

determined by Chief examiner (5) Except where otherwise stated, qualifying sea

going service of marine engineer officers and engine room ratings means time

spent on board ships from the date of engagement to the date of discharge on

ships with propelling machinery and or auxiliary machinery in full use subject

to paragraph (6) below (6) When part of the service has been performed on ships

which, for considerable periods have not been underway, a statement from the

Master of the ship shall be produced stating the time in days actually underway.

In such circumstances qualifying sea going service may be counted as one and

half times the actual number of days spent underway, and in no case can it

exceed the actual time spent on board during the period concerned. (7) Sea going

service performed by engineer officers employed in work practices on ships

operated on other than the traditional watch keeping routine, may be accepted as

qualifying sea going service, if the Chief Examiner concerned is satisfied that

such work practices provide equivalent experience.
