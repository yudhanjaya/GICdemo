Specifications for black tea and ISO 3720:1986; Black tea- Definition and basic

requirement) and the connected Tea Board regulations. SLSI – SLTB: Product

Certification Scheme for Tea (PCST) is designed to meet the specific needs of

the tea plantation sector and to provide an internationally recognized third

Guide 65: 1996; General requirements for bodies operating product certification

systems, which provides general rules for third party certification of

determining with standards through initial testing and assessment of a factory

Quality Management system and its acceptance followed by surveillance that takes

System combined with additional requirements on process control and product

testing as specified in the relevant standards along with applicable legal
