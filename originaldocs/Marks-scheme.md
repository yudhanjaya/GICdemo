How to obtain a permit to use the Product Certification Mark (SLS Mark)

PRODUCT CERTIFICATION

Product certification Scheme which is popularly known as the "SLS Marks Scheme",

is a scheme that gives a third party guarantee on quality of a product. This

scheme enables the SLSI to grant permits to local as well as overseas

manufacturers producing goods conforming to Sri Lanka Standards to mark the

"SLS" mark on their products. Sri Lanka Standards Institution Act No.6 of 1984,

and the regulations made there under empower the Sri Lanka Standards Institution

to issue such permits to manufacturers.

The Product Certification Scheme is essentially voluntary in nature. However,

SLS Mark has been made compulsory through the Directions issued under the

Consumer Protection Act No. 1 of 1979 and Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9

of 2003.

The Certification Mark on a commodity or product signifies that the commodity or

product is consistently manufactured in accordance with the relevant Sri Lanka

Standard Specification and could be purchased with a reasonable assurance of

quality. Compliance with the requirements of the specification is assured

through regular monitoring of the quality assurance system through audits

carried out by qualified Auditors of the Institution and product testing.

The general policy of the Institution is to administer the Certification Marks

Scheme in such a manner that the responsibility of compliance with the relevant

standard lies with the manufacturer. To secure this, a suitable quality

assurance system consistent with the guidelines prescribed by the Institution

should be adopted by each Permit Holder. He is responsible for the documentation

and the implementation of the quality system and the continued effectiveness of

the quality system will be verified by the qualified officers of the Institution

at regular intervals.

Scope of the permit

Separate Permits should be obtained for commodities or products falling within

the same standard specification but marketed under different brand names. If the

same commodity or product bearing the same brand name is made at more than one

plant, separate Permits should be obtained simultaneously for each and every

plant. A Permit will not be issued unless all plants manufacturing the same

commodity or product under the same brand name comply with the requirements of

the Permit.

How to apply for a permit

A manufacturer desirous of obtaining a Permit to use the Certification Mark on a

commodity or product must first ascertain whether a Sri Lanka Standard

Specification has been approved and published by the Institution for the

product/commodity concerned. Applications shall be submitted on the prescribed

form and separate applications shall be made for each commodity or product

covered by a particular standard.

If the commodity or product bearing the same brand name is produced at more than

one plant of the applicant, separate applications must be submitted

simultaneously in respect of each and every plant manufacturing that commodity

or product under the same brand name.
