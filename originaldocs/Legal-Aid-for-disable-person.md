Disabled Persons Desk

The legal issues arising out of being differently abled (disabled) are purely

humanitarian and applies to all societies in the world. The disabled whether

mental or physical, unless actively assisted are prevented from developing their

full potential as human being. The differently able are also victims due to

social prejudice against them.

The UN Convention on the rights of the disabled unanimously adopted by the UN

general Assembly last week would be translated to Sinhala and Tamil for the

benefit of the general public.

The Legal Aid Commission has set up the Disabled Persons Legal Aid Desk in order

 property and fundamental rights of destitute disabled persons.

 * To create an awareness on the subject among community and school children on

 the rights of disabled persons.

 Disabled Persons in the process of Disabled Persons Empowerment.
