Energy Labeling Scheme

Guidelines and procedures for energy efficiency rating

1.Introduction

Engineering Standardization Division of Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI),

operates the Energy Efficiency Labeling Scheme for electrical appliances based

on the relevant Sri Lanka Standards for energy efficiency rating of appliances.

The Institution offers this scheme to importers and manufacturers of electrical

appliances to join on a voluntary basis.

2. Energy Efficiency Standards

Availability of Sri Lanka Standards for Energy Efficiency Labelling is a prior

requirement to operate this scheme.Specification for the label and the method of

determination of star rating are specified in SLS 1200 for Magnetic Ballasts and

SLS 1225 for Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL’s). The project on labelling of

Refrigerators and Freezers will commence shortly.

3. Energy Efficiency Label

3.1 The Energy Efficiency Label shall have the dimensions, format and all the

information prescribed in the relevant Sri Lanka Standard.

3.2 Depending on the energy loss / consumption / conversion efficiency of an

appliance the efficiency rating shall be determined and designated by a number

of stars as per the relevant Sri Lanka Standard. The highest efficiency-rating

category of appliances may be assigned with five stars and as the efficiency

lowers a lesser number of stars will be assigned. The greater the number of

stars the higher the efficiency rating of an appliance.

4. Application

4.1 A manufacturer or an importer shall make an application in respect of each

model/type of the appliance. If the same model/type is manufactured in factories

in different locations a separate application shall be made in respect of each

location and the model/type.

4.2 In case of imports, the applicant shall be the sole agent for the model/type

of the appliance for which the application is made for Energy Efficiency

Labelling.

4.3 Duly completed application form shall be forwarded to the Director

(Engineering), Sri Lanka Standards Institution.

5. Testing of sample

5.1 Random Samples drawn from the manufacturer / importer shall be tested to

find out the efficacy, power factor of each model of lamps energy loss /

consumption as per the relevant Sri Lanka Standard by the SLSI laboratory or any

other recognized laboratory.

6. Certificatoin

6.1 The Director (Engineering) or his delegate shall determine the star rating,

of an appliance, based on the test report and the method given in the relevant

Sri Lanka Standard.

6.2 Before awarding a certificate the applicant shall sign an agreement with the

SLSI.

6.3 The certificate shall be issued under the signature of the Director General,

SLSI, authorizing the applicant to affix/display the label as prescribed in the

certificate, on his/her product.

6.4 The certificate shall be valid for a period of three years from the date of

issue of the certificate unless otherwise specified.

6.5 When the applicant has lodged a number of applications in respect of number

of locations he shall be issued separate certificates in respect of each

model/type of the appliance manufactured at different locations.

7. Surveillance Inspection

7.1 The SLSI from time to time obtain samples of the product for testing from

the market / manufacturer / importer.

7.2 The certificate holder shall arrange for the product in batches and for the

containers used, if any to be marked in the manner acceptable to the

Institution, in order that any particular sample of the product may be traced to

its batch. The definition of the batch, details of batch identification,

decoding system of the batch identification etc. should be made available to the

Institution by the certificate holder.

8. Certification Fees

8.1 The certificate holder shall pay a fee of LKR 500/= for the application

form, and a certification fee of LKR 5000/= at the time of issue of the

certificate.

8.2 The manufacturer/importer shall bear the cost of testing fee and the cost of

collection of samples at the initial testing and during the period of the

validity of the certificate.

9. Printing of Labels

9.1 The label shall be printed by the manufacturer/ importer.

9.2 Detailed information, with respect to the number of labels used serial

numbers of the appliances on which the labels are used shall be made available

to SLSI, to prevent misuse of labels by any party.

9.3 The label shall always be used with the type/model of the product with a

distinctive registered trademark / brand name as prescribed in the certificate

issued to the manufacturer or the importer
