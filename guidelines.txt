# Writing Guide for Sri Lankan Government Information Articles

This guide helps content creators write clear, consistent, and user-focused articles about government services and functions. Our goal is to help citizens quickly understand and access government services.

Write every article as if explaining it to someone who has never dealt with government services before. Assume no prior knowledge.

## Article Structure

### 1. Metadata

Metadata goes at the top of a document and helps us internally identify and serve information better. Document metadata must begin and end with "---". 
In between must be information in the following format:

> ---
> # Core identification
> title: Document title
> document_id: Unique identifier
> document_type: guide|form|policy|notice
> version: X.Y

> # Classification
> category: Primary category
> subcategory: Specific subcategory
> status: draft|review|published

> # Departmental
> department: Department name
> division: Specific division
> authority: Legal or administrative authority

> # Language and translations
> language: sinhala|tamil|english
> available_translations: [sinhala, tamil, english]

> # Dates
> published_date: YYYY-MM-DD
> last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
> next_review: YYYY-MM-DD

> # Legal and scope
> applicable_laws: 
>  - List of governing laws
> geographic_scope: national|provincial|district

> # Contact
> contact_division: Division name
> contact_phone: Primary contact number
> contact_email: Primary email

> ---

Every document must start with complete and accurate metadata. Fill in all required fields using the exact format shown in the template, including proper formatting and correct date formats (YYYY-MM-DD). Keep the information up to date by checking details regularly and updating version numbers, dates, and status when anything changes. Use only official names for categories, departments, and contact information, and ensure all contact details include proper country codes and official email addresses.


### 2. Title

- Use action-oriented titles that describe the service (e.g., "Apply for a new passport" rather than "Passport information")
- Keep titles concise and under 65 characters
- Use sentence case (e.g., "Register your business in Sri Lanka")


### 3. First Paragraph
Tell people immediately:
- What this service or process is
- Why they might need it
- Who can use it



### 4. Important Information

Next, tell people about:
- Deadlines ("You must apply within 42 days of birth")
- Costs ("Registration is free for the first 42 days. After that, there's a fee of [amount]")
- Where to go ("Visit any Divisional Secretariat office")

### 5. What People Need
List everything people must prepare:

For each document needed:
- What it is
- What it looks like
- Where to get it
- How long it takes to get
- What to do if they don't have it



### 6. Step-by-Step Process
Break down every step:
1. What to do first
2. Where to go
3. What happens when you get there
4. How long each step takes
5. What happens next


### 7. Additional Help Section
Tell people how to get help if they need it:

"If you need help:
- Call [phone number]
    - Lines open 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday to Friday
    - You can speak in Sinhala, Tamil, or English
    - Calls are charged at normal rates

- Visit any Divisional Secretariat office
    - Bring your National Identity Card
    - Staff can explain the process in person
    - No appointment needed

- Email [email address]
    - Responses usually take 2 working days
    - Include your phone number in your email"

## Writing Style

### Use Simple Language
Write like you're explaining to a friend:
- "You need to bring" (not "Applicants must provide")
- "Fill out the form" (not "Complete the documentation")
- "This takes 3 days" (not "Processing time is 3 working days")

### Explain Every Term
Don't assume people know government terms:

### Use Short Sentences
- One idea per sentence
- Break up long explanations into steps
- Use bullet points for lists

### Numbers and Dates
- Write numbers up to ten in words, use digits for 11 and above
- Use the format DD/MM/YYYY for dates
- Write time in 24-hour format
- Include time zones where relevant (Sri Lanka Standard Time)

### Lists and Bullets
- Use bullet points for lists of items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Start each bullet with a capital letter
- End each bullet with a period if it's a complete sentence

### Format
- Use headings hierarchically (H1, H2, H3)
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences maximum)
- Use adequate spacing between sections
- Include alternative text for images
- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here")

### Visual Elements
- Use tables for comparing information
- Include captions for images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Use official government icons consistently


### Multilingual Considerations
- Maintain consistent terminology across Sinhala, Tamil, and English versions
- Include English transliterations of Sinhala/Tamil terms where helpful
- Use standard government translations for official terms



### Show Examples
Don't assume that people know what documents and forms look like. Where possible, include:
- Photos of documents when possible
- Sample filled-out forms
- Maps to offices
- Pictures of office buildings

## Before Publishing


Before publishing, ensure the article:
- Follows the style guide
- Contains accurate, up-to-date information
- Includes all necessary contact details
- Links to relevant forms and documents
- Is available in all required languages
- Has been proofread

Check that your article:

1. Explains what every term means
2. Lists exact costs
3. Gives clear locations
4. Shows all steps
5. Tells people where to get help
6. Works in all three languages (Sinhala, Tamil, English)

## Keep Content Updated

Review articles when:
- Review content every 6 months
- Update when procedures change
- Maintain version history
- Include last updated date on each article
- Archive outdated versions
Add the review date at the bottom of each article.
