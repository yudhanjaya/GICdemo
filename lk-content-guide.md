# Writing Guide for Sri Lankan Government Information Articles

## Basic Principles

Write every article as if explaining it to someone who has never dealt with government services before. Assume no prior knowledge.

## Article Structure

### 1. Title
Make it action-focused:
- "How to get a birth certificate" (good)
- "Birth certificate information" (bad)

### 2. First Paragraph
Tell people immediately:
- What this service or process is
- Why they might need it
- Who can use it

Example:
"A birth certificate is an official document that proves when and where someone was born. You need it for school admissions, passports, and other official purposes. Every person born in Sri Lanka should have one."

### 3. Important Information
Next, tell people about:
- Deadlines ("You must apply within 42 days of birth")
- Costs ("Registration is free for the first 42 days. After that, there's a fee of [amount]")
- Where to go ("Visit any Divisional Secretariat office")

### 4. What People Need
List everything people must prepare:

For each document needed:
- What it is
- What it looks like
- Where to get it
- How long it takes to get
- What to do if they don't have it

Example:
"You need a Grama Niladhari certificate. This is a letter from your local village officer that proves where you live. To get it:
1. Visit your local Grama Niladhari office
2. Bring your National Identity Card
3. The certificate usually takes 2-3 days to receive
4. There is no fee for this certificate"

### 5. Step-by-Step Process
Break down every step:
1. What to do first
2. Where to go
3. What happens when you get there
4. How long each step takes
5. What happens next

Example:
"1. Go to your local Divisional Secretariat office
    - Find your nearest office using our office locator
    - Offices are open Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM
    - You don't need an appointment

2. At the office
    - Go to the information desk
    - Tell them you want to register a birth
    - They will direct you to the correct counter

3. At the counter
    - Show your documents
    - Fill out the application form
    - The officer will check your information

4. Getting your certificate
    - If all documents are correct, you'll get the certificate the same day
    - They will give you [number] copies
    - Keep these copies safe - getting replacements takes time and costs money"

### 6. Help Section
Tell people how to get help:

"If you need help:
- Call [phone number]
    - Lines open 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday to Friday
    - You can speak in Sinhala, Tamil, or English
    - Calls are charged at normal rates

- Visit any Divisional Secretariat office
    - Bring your National Identity Card
    - Staff can explain the process in person
    - No appointment needed

- Email [email address]
    - Responses usually take 2 working days
    - Include your phone number in your email"

## Writing Style

### Use Simple Language
Write like you're explaining to a friend:
- "You need to bring" (not "Applicants must provide")
- "Fill out the form" (not "Complete the documentation")
- "This takes 3 days" (not "Processing time is 3 working days")

### Explain Every Term
Don't assume people know government terms:

Bad: "Submit your GN certificate"
Good: "Bring your Grama Niladhari certificate (the letter from your local village officer that proves where you live)"

### Use Short Sentences
- One idea per sentence
- Break up long explanations into steps
- Use bullet points for lists

### Show Examples
Include:
- Photos of documents when possible
- Sample filled-out forms
- Maps to offices
- Pictures of office buildings

## Before Publishing

Check that your article:
1. Explains what every term means
2. Lists exact costs
3. Gives clear locations
4. Shows all steps
5. Tells people where to get help
6. Works in all three languages (Sinhala, Tamil, English)

## Keep Content Updated

Review articles when:
- Processes change
- Costs change
- Office locations change
- Contact details change

Add the review date at the bottom of each article.
