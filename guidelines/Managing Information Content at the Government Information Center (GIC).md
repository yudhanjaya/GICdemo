# **Managing Information Content at the Government Information Center (GIC)**

## **Overview**

The Government Information Center (GIC) serves as the central hub for disseminating government information to the public. Our content management policies ensure that citizens receive accurate, timely, and relevant information about government services and programs.

All information shared through GIC channels (including the 1919 hotline, web portal, and physical information desks) must meet public needs and fulfill our mandate of transparent government communication.

## **Managing Outdated Information**

When information becomes outdated, we have two options for handling it:

1. Archive the information while maintaining access for historical reference  
2. Remove the information completely from our systems

Some information may change when the government changes. For the relevant procedure, keep reading. 

## **Archiving Outdated Information**

When you archive information in the GIC system:

* It remains accessible to GIC officers for reference  
* Call center operators can access it but must inform callers that it is outdated  
* Web portal entries show a clear notice that the information is no longer current  
* Physical information desk materials are moved to the archive section

Guidelines for archiving:

* Service information should be updated rather than archived when minor details change  
* Information about completed or expired government programs should be archived  
* When programs are mostly unchanged but have minor updates, edit the existing information rather than creating new entries

Archive notices are especially important for information from previous administrations to ensure transparency about the source and timing of the information.

### **Special Cases**

#### **Public Consultations**

Records of public consultations should be maintained in our system as they document public participation in governance. Only archive consultation information when a new consultation explicitly replaces an older one.

#### **Development Projects**

For ongoing development projects:

* Archive older versions of project plans  
* Maintain only current implementation details  
* Keep a timeline of major project changes  
* Ensure all archived information links to current project status

## **Editing Archived Information**

Archived information can be updated to:

* Fix factual errors  
* Update contact information  
* Correct technical mistakes  
* Add cross-references to newer programs

## **Removing Information**

Complete removal of information from GIC systems should be rare. Consider removal only when:

* Information has been consolidated into newer materials  
* The service or program is better explained in new documentation  
* Information was released prematurely  
* Content contains private citizen data  
* Information relates to expunged legal records  
* Content falls outside GIC's scope  
* Information violates copyright  
* Content is inappropriate or incorrect

When removing information:

1. Update all GIC channels (hotline scripts, web content, printed materials)  
2. Notify relevant government departments  
3. Train staff on directing inquiries about the removed information  
4. Maintain internal records of what was removed and why

### **Handling Sensitive Information**

For information containing personal data or sensitive details:

1. Remove immediately from all public-facing channels  
2. Update call center scripts to reflect the change  
3. Recall any printed materials  
4. Document the removal in our internal records  
5. Notify relevant authorities if necessary

## **Information from Previous Administrations**

When there is a change in administration:

* Clearly mark relevant information as from the previous administration  
* Maintain factual program and service details  
* Update contact information and procedures as needed  
* Keep records of when and why changes were made

### **Updates to Previous Administration Content**

Only edit such content to:

* Fix technical errors  
* Update contact information  
* Add new procedural information  
* Include official responses to public inquiries

Contact the GIC Director for approval before making any changes to information marked as from a previous administration.

## **Staff Training and Support**

All GIC staff must be trained on:

* Identifying outdated information  
* Proper archival procedures  
* When to remove versus archive information  
* Handling sensitive information  
* Maintaining transparency while updating information

For questions about these procedures, consult your supervisor or the Content Management Unit.
