If you have received a permanent and pensionable appointment in the public service, you can apply to receive your Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) benefits. This guide explains the process to claim your EPF benefits in this situation.

To be eligible, your appointment must be permanent and pensionable. It is also compulsory that you have left your previous employment at the time of claiming the benefits.

To claim your EPF benefits:

1. Complete the "K Form" application. You can download this form from the Department of Labour website.
2. Gather the required documents:
   - Application certified by your last employer
   - Copies of your "B" cards showing your EPF membership numbers
   - A copy of your National Identity Card certified by your employer
   - A copy of your bank passbook
   - Your original letter of appointment showing your post is permanent and pensionable
   - A service certificate from the head of your current institution, issued within the last 3 months
   - Your salary report and employee ID card
3. If you were in the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, you must also submit a formal service certificate confirming your post was permanent and pensionable, along with your salary report and employee ID card.
4. If you are claiming benefits for a local authority position, you must also provide a letter of recommendation for the 60%/40% payment allocation.
5. Submit the completed application form and documents to your nearest District Labour Office or Labour Sub-Office during regular business hours.

The processing time is approximately 3 weeks, provided all required documents are submitted.
