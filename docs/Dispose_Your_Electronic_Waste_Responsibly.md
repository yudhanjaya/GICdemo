## Dispose Your Electronic Waste Responsibly

Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, refers to discarded, obsolete, or broken electrical and electronic devices. As developing countries like Sri Lanka often rely on low-cost imported electronics, a significant portion of these imported items may be non-functional and require proper disposal.

Improper disposal of e-waste can have serious environmental and health consequences. Electronic devices may contain toxic substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants that can contaminate the environment and accumulate in the food chain.

To address this issue, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has initiated a program to collect and manage e-waste in an environmentally friendly manner. You can contribute to this effort by responsibly disposing of your electronic waste through the following collection centers:
