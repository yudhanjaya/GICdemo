## Maintaining Continuous Operation at Pumping Stations in Urban Housing Projects

This guide explains the process for reporting issues with pumping stations in urban housing projects and getting them resolved by the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA).

Pumping stations are critical infrastructure that ensure continuous water supply to residents of urban housing projects. If a pumping station is not functioning properly, it can disrupt water access for the entire community. This guide outlines the steps to follow to inform the NHDA about any issues and get them addressed promptly.

## Important Information

- You can report pumping station issues by fax to 0112438132 or 0112438130.
- There is no fee to submit a report or request maintenance.
- Normal service repairs are completed within 3 days. For urgent issues, a "prime service" can be requested and will be addressed within 12 hours.

## What You Need

To report a pumping station issue, you will need:
- Your name and contact information
- The location of the affected pumping station
- Details about the problem, such as the pump not functioning

## Reporting a Problem

1. Contact the NHDA by fax at 0112438132 or 0112438130 to inform them that a pumping station is not working properly.
2. Provide your name, contact details, the location of the pumping station, and a description of the issue.
3. If the problem is urgent, request the "prime service" to have it addressed within 12 hours. Otherwise, the normal service will be provided within 3 days.
