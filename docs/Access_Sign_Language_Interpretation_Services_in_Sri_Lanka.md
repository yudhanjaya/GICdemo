# Access Sign Language Interpretation Services in Sri Lanka

According to the 2012 census, there are 389,077 hearing-impaired or semi-hearing-impaired persons and 180,833 persons with communication disorders in Sri Lanka. Sign language is the primary means of communication for these individuals to access educational, social, cultural, medical, health, and legal services.

In 2010, the Cabinet of Ministers made a policy decision to recognize sign language as an official language in Sri Lanka. The Department of Social Services now provides sign language interpretation services to help hearing-impaired individuals communicate with public sector institutions, such as police stations, courts, and hospitals.
