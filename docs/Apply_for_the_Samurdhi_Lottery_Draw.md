The Samurdhi Lottery Draw is a biannual program organized by the Samurdhi Authority to provide financial assistance to Samurdhi beneficiaries who do not own their own homes. As a Samurdhi beneficiary, you are automatically entered into the lottery draw and do not need to apply separately.

The Samurdhi Authority holds a lottery draw every 6 months and selects 1,236 winners nationwide. Each winner receives a prize of Rs. 150,000 to help them build their own house.

To be eligible for the Samurdhi Lottery Draw, you must:
- Be a registered Samurdhi beneficiary
- Not currently own your own home

If you have a fully developed house, you may still be able to receive the prize for other self-employment activities, subject to approval by your Divisional Secretary.

The cost of the lottery is covered by the Samurdhi stamps issued to beneficiaries. You will be provided with a lottery card, and there is no need to submit a separate application.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. The Samurdhi Authority maintains a database of all Samurdhi beneficiaries, which is updated every 6 months.
2. The Authority conducts the lottery draw every 6 months and selects 1,236 winners across the country.
3. The list of winners is sent to the respective Divisional Secretariats for approval.
4. The Assistant Samurdhi Commissioner in each district verifies the eligibility of the winners through a field visit.
5. The confirmed list of winners is sent back to the Samurdhi Authority.
6. The Authority prepares and sends cheques to the Assistant Samurdhi Commissioners through the Divisional Secretariats.
7. The winners must visit the Assistant Samurdhi Commissioner in their district to collect the cheque, presenting their lottery card as proof of identity.
8. The Divisional Secretariat informs the winners by post to collect the cheque.
