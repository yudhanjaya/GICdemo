## Social Development Programs in Sri Lanka

The Sri Lanka Samurdhi Authority runs several social development programs to address the needs of underprivileged groups and improve the overall well-being of the population. These programs cover a range of areas, including drug control, child welfare, commemorating international days, elder care, and housing assistance.

## Drug Control Program
Drug abuse can have devastating effects on families and communities, leading to poverty and other social problems. The Samurdhi Authority's drug control program aims to minimize drug use and alleviate poverty. These programs are implemented at the divisional secretariat level across the country.

## Prevention of Child Abuse and Child Welfare
The Samurdhi Authority collaborates with the National Child Protection Authority to protect children's rights and prevent child abuse. Activities include drawing competitions, children's markets, talent shows, and programs to promote cultural and ethical values.

## Commemorating International Days
The social development program organizes island-wide events to commemorate four key international days throughout the year:
- International Women's Day (March 8)
- World No Tobacco Day (May 31) 
- International Literacy Day (September 8)
- International Day for the Eradication of Poverty (October 10-17)
- International Children's and Parents' Day (October 1)

## Welfare of Elders
The Samurdhi Authority runs programs to commemorate International Elders' Day on October 1 each year, focusing on the needs and well-being of the elderly population.

## Housing Assistance
The social development program identifies poor and homeless individuals at the Grama Niladhari, regional, and divisional levels, and provides them with new homes through the Social Development Foundation.
