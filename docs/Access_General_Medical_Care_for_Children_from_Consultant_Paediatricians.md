## Access General Medical Care for Children from Consultant Paediatricians

This guide explains how parents and guardians can access general medical care for children from consultant paediatricians in Sri Lanka. Whether your child needs routine check-ups, treatment for an illness, or specialized care, this information will help you understand the process.

## Important Information

- Paediatric consultations are available at designated government hospitals across the country.
- Services are provided free of charge for children under the age of 12.
- You must bring your child's past medical records to each appointment.

## What You Need

To access paediatric care, you will need to provide the following:

- Your child's birth certificate
- Your child's National Identity Card (if applicable)
- Your child's past medical records, including any test results or prescriptions

If you do not have all of these documents, the hospital staff can still provide care, but it's best to bring as much information as possible.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Visit the paediatric outpatient department (OPD) at your nearest government hospital.
2. Register your child at the reception desk and provide the required documents.
3. Wait to be called for your appointment with the consultant paediatrician.
4. The paediatrician will examine your child and provide any necessary treatment or referrals.
5. If your child requires follow-up care, the paediatrician will schedule the next appointment before you leave.

Appointments are available Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and on Saturdays from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM.
