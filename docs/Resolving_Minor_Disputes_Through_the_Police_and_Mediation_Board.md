## Resolving Minor Disputes Through the Police and Mediation Board

If you have a minor dispute with someone, you can file a complaint with the police to try and resolve the issue. This process allows you to seek a resolution without going to court.

The police will first evaluate your complaint and direct you to the Minor Offences Division. They will record your complaint and issue you a B form, which is a reference document for your case.

The police will then summon the other party to the station and try to help solve the problem. If they are unable to resolve the dispute, they will refer the case to the Mediation Board.

The Mediation Board will also attempt to help the parties reach an agreement. If they are still unable to resolve the dispute, the Mediation Board will advise you to take the case to court.

## What You Need

To file a complaint, you will need to visit the police station and provide information about the dispute. You should have any relevant evidence or documents related to the issue.

## The Process

1. Go to your nearest police station and inform the officer about your dispute.
