## Accessing Legal Aid for Sri Lankan Migrant Workers

Sri Lankan workers who migrate to the Middle East and other countries can face various difficulties, both in Sri Lanka and overseas, due to a lack of knowledge about the basic labor laws in their home country and the host country. The Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka has set up a Migrant Workers' Desk to provide free legal aid assistance to these workers before departure, during their stay abroad, and upon return.

## Important Information

- The Migrant Workers Desk is headed by T.M.Lilanthi Kumari, Attorney-at-Law, who has conducted several awareness programs to safeguard the safety, rights, and interests of migrant workers.
- The Legal Aid Commission is hoping to set up a Legal Aid Branch at the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau to assist migrant workers more effectively and avoid delays.

To access legal aid services from the Migrant Workers Desk, you will need to:

- Bring your National Identity Card or other valid ID.
- Provide details about your employment and any issues you have faced.
- Be prepared to discuss the legal conditions in the country you are working in and any rights that may have been violated.
