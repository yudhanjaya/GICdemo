## Register and Certify Seed Production in Sri Lanka

The Seed Certification Service (SCS) of the Department of Agriculture oversees the registration of seed production crops and certification of the produced seeds. This process ensures that farmers and consumers have access to high-quality, certified seeds for crops like rice, field crops, and vegetables.

## Important Information

- Registration fees:
    - Paddy: LKR 400 per acre per season
    - Field crops: LKR 400 per acre per season per lot
    - Vegetables: LKR 400 per acre per season per lot
    - Potato: LKR 800 per acre per season per lot
- Minimum land requirements:
    - Paddy: 1 acre
    - Field crops: 1 acre
    - Vegetables: 1 acre
    - Potato: 1 acre

## What You Need

To register your seed production crop, you'll need to provide:
- Proof of origin for the basic seed lot
- Information on the variety, seed class, and basic seed details
- A sketch of the land with boundaries
- For potato: Confirmation that the land has been free from solanaceous crops (like tomato, brinjal, chili) for the last 2 years

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Submit a request to the Deputy Director of the Seed Certification Service (SCS) by letter or email, providing details like your name, address, contact information, crop, variety, seed class, lot number, quantity of seeds, land extent, and planting date.
2. The SCS will review your request and, if approved, an SCS officer will visit your field to check the basic requirements.
3. If you meet the eligibility criteria, your seed production crop will be registered.
4. The SCS will conduct 2-3 inspection visits during the growing season to monitor the crop.
5. At maturity, a final inspection will determine if the crop is accepted for seed production.
6. After harvesting, a sample will be tested at an SCS seed testing laboratory.
7. Only approved seed lots will be released as certified seeds with the relevant SCS labels.
