The State Dance Contest and Festival is an annual event organized by the Department of Cultural Affairs to celebrate National Dance Day. This festival provides an opportunity for Kalayatanas (cultural centers), dance organizations, and arts institutions across Sri Lanka to showcase their traditional dance forms.

The festival features competitions in five dance categories: Up-country Dance, Low-country Dance, Sabaragamuwa Dance, Rural Dance, and Tamil Dance. The competition is held in two rounds - a district-level primary round, followed by a national-level final contest. The top three troupes in the final contest will receive certificates and cash awards.

To participate, your Kalayatana, cultural center, or arts organization must submit an application form along with a list of your performers' names, dates of birth, and national identity card numbers. There is no application fee. The application deadline and other important details are published in newspapers and other media outlets.
