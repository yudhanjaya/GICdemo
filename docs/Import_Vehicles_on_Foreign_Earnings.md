## Import Vehicles on Foreign Earnings

If you have returned from foreign employment, you may be able to import a vehicle you used abroad. This guide explains the requirements and process for importing a vehicle using your foreign earnings.

To qualify, you must:
- Have returned from foreign employment
- Have registered the vehicle in your name and used it abroad
- Have the required documents, including your passport and vehicle registration certificate

The vehicle must be right-hand drive and cannot have air conditioning using CFC. You can only import a vehicle once every 5 years, and you cannot transfer ownership for 3 years after import.

## What You Need
To apply, you'll need to provide:
- Vehicle registration certificate (with English translation)
- Photocopies of your passport pages showing your name, expiry date, departure, and arrival dates
- Bank statements proving your foreign earnings

## Application Process
1. Obtain the application form from Unit 2.
2. Submit the completed form and supporting documents to Unit 2.
3. If everything is in order, the Assistant Controller will approve the license.
4. Pay the license fee at the cashier and submit the receipt to Unit 2.
5. Receive your import license.

The process takes 1-2 working days. The license is valid for 3 months. You can request an extension if needed.

## Costs
- There is no cost to obtain the application form.
