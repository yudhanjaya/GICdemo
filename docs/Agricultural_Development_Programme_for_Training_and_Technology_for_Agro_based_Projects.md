## What is the Agricultural Development Programme?

The Agricultural Development Programme is an initiative by the Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka to support and empower rural communities through various agricultural projects and interventions. The primary goal is to help Samurdhi beneficiaries achieve a minimum monthly income of Rs. 5,000 by providing technical training, resources, and other necessary facilities to implement sustainable and productive agro-based projects.

## Key Components of the Programme

1. **Training and Appropriate Technologies for Agro-based Projects**: The programme offers training programmes on cultivating fruits, vegetables, export crops, and other field crops, in collaboration with support service institutions like the Department of Agriculture, Export Agriculture Department, Tea Small Holders Authority, and Coconut Cultivation Board.

2. **Local Food Items Promotional Projects**: This component aims to identify and utilize the resources and potential available at the village level to implement viable and sustainable local food item production by beneficiary groups.

3. **Promotion of Post-Harvest and Processing Technology**: The programme focuses on setting up facilities, such as onion storage units, to help beneficiaries process and package their produce to obtain better market prices.

4. **Sustainable Agricultural Water Management Project**: This project provides solar-powered drip irrigation systems to farmers in dry and semi-dry areas to enhance productivity through modern agricultural techniques and proper farm management practices.

5. **Home Garden Development Programme**: The programme assists Samurdhi beneficiary families in establishing home gardens to produce fresh vegetables, fruits, and livestock products, thereby increasing productivity and improving nutrition levels.

6. **Tree Planting and Environment Conservation Programme**: This initiative involves tree planting activities with the participation of Samurdhi beneficiaries to create awareness about environmental management and rehabilitation of ecologically vulnerable areas.

## Eligibility and Funding

- The selected beneficiaries must be able to meet the operational expenditure from a loan granted by the Samurdhi Bank.
- The Samurdhi Authority's Agriculture Development Division can provide a certain proportion of the funds for small and medium-scale projects, while micro-projects may be initiated with a loan from the Samurdhi Bank.
- For planting material, the Agriculture Division covers 50% of the cost, and the remaining 50% is contributed by the beneficiaries.

## How to Apply

To apply for the Agricultural Development Programme, interested Samurdhi beneficiaries should contact their local Divisional Secretariat office or Samurdhi Development Officer. They will assist in preparing the necessary project proposal and submitting it through the proper channels for approval.
