## Obtain a Visit Visa for Sri Lanka

If you're planning to visit Sri Lanka as a tourist, you'll need to apply for a Visit Visa. This guide explains the process and requirements for obtaining a Visit Visa.

A Visit Visa allows you to enter Sri Lanka for tourism purposes, such as sightseeing, visiting friends or family, or attending events. It is valid for up to 30 days, with the possibility of extending it for an additional 2 months.

## Important Information

- The application fee for a Visit Visa is LKR 5,000 (approximately USD 14).
- You must apply for the Visit Visa before your intended travel dates.
- Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your planned stay in Sri Lanka.

## What You Need

To apply for a Visit Visa, you'll need to prepare the following:

- A completed Visit Visa application form
- A copy of your passport
- A recent passport-sized photograph
- Proof of sufficient funds for your stay (e.g., bank statements, credit card statements)
- Proof of accommodation (e.g., hotel booking, invitation letter from host)
- Proof of onward travel (e.g., return flight ticket)

## Application Process

1. Complete the Visit Visa application form, which you can download from the Department of Immigration and Emigration website.
2. Gather all the required documents listed above.
3. Submit your application and documents to the nearest Sri Lankan embassy or consulate, or apply online through the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system at https://www.eta.gov.lk.
4. Pay the application fee.
5. Wait for your application to be processed, which typically takes 3-5 working days.
6. Once your visa is approved, you can collect it from the embassy or consulate, or it will be electronically linked to your passport.

## Extending Your Visit Visa

If you need to stay in Sri Lanka longer than the initial 30 days, you can apply for a 2-month extension at the Department of Immigration and Emigration's head office in Colombo. You'll need to submit the following:

- A completed visa extension application form
- A copy of your passport
- Proof of funds and accommodation for the extended stay

The extension fee is LKR 10,000 (approximately USD 28).
