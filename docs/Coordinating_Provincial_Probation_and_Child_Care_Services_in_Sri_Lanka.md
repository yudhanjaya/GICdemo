## Coordinating Provincial Probation and Child Care Services in Sri Lanka

The Department of Probation and Child Care Services is responsible for the rehabilitation of those under probation and other welfare activities for children in Sri Lanka. This department operates at both the national and provincial levels to coordinate services.

After the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, the subject of probation and child care services was decentralized, and nine Provincial Departments of Probation and Child Care Services were established. These provincial departments work under the purview of the minister responsible for the subject.

The national Department of Probation and Child Care Services coordinates with the provincial departments to ensure the effective delivery of probation and child welfare services across the country. A probation office has been established for each judicial division under the respective provincial department.

Citizens can contact the nearest Provincial Department or Probation Office to access probation services. The contact details for each provincial department and probation office are provided below.
