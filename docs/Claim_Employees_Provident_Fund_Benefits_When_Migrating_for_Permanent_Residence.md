## Claim Employees' Provident Fund Benefits When Migrating for Permanent Residence

If you are leaving Sri Lanka to live permanently in another country, you can claim your Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) benefits before you go. This guide explains the process to claim your EPF benefits when migrating for permanent residence.

To claim your EPF benefits, you must have already left your job in Sri Lanka. You'll also need to have a valid permanent residency visa for the country you are moving to.

- A copy of your National Identity Card certified by your employer
- A copy of the bio-data page of your valid passport
- A copy of your valid permanent residency visa
- A copy of the first page of your bank passbook

If someone else is submitting the claim on your behalf, they'll also need:

- A copy of your permanent residency visa and passport certified by the Sri Lankan embassy in the country you are moving to
- Your signed authorization letter or request letter, also certified by the Sri Lankan embassy
