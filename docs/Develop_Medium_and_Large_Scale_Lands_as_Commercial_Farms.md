# Develop Medium and Large Scale Lands as Commercial Farms

This guide explains the process for planning and developing medium and large scale lands (over 2-3 acres) as commercial farms in Sri Lanka.

If you own or have legal authority over a medium or large scale piece of land, you can apply to have it officially designated and developed as a commercial farm. This allows you to access government support and resources to improve your land for agricultural production.

## Important Information

- There is no fee to apply for commercial farm designation.
- However, if a specialized team needs to visit your land, you may need to provide transport or cover fuel expenses.
- The application process will be completed as soon as possible, but there is no set timeline.

## What You Need

To apply, you'll need to provide:
- Proof of land ownership or legal authority over the land
- Details about the size, location, and current use of the land
