# Registration and Re-registration of Private Employees

This guide explains how private employers can register and re-register their employees with the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) in Sri Lanka.

The EPF is a mandatory retirement savings scheme that requires all private sector employers to enroll their employees and make monthly contributions. Registering new employees and re-registering existing ones ensures they are properly enrolled and their contributions are recorded.

## Important Information

- Registration must be done within 14 days of hiring a new employee.
- There is no fee to register employees.
- Late registration may result in fines for the employer, ranging from 5% to 50% of the contributions owed.

## What You Need

To register or re-register employees, you'll need:

- 2 completed and signed copies of Form D
- If you have 10 or fewer employees, 2 copies of the Form D Annexure with your company seal
- If you have more than 10 employees, a list of all employees including their full names, ages, job titles, wages, and hire dates (certified by the person who signed Form D)
- Copies of relevant business registration documents (sole proprietorship, partnership, or company)
- Copy of the National ID card for the business owner or authorized representative signing Form D

## How to Register or Re-register Employees

1. Obtain the required Form D and any additional documents needed.
2. Complete Form D with all employee details.
3. Submit the completed forms and supporting documents to your local District Labour Office or Labour Sub-Office during regular business hours.
4. Registration at the head office takes 1 day, while registration at other offices takes up to 7 days.
