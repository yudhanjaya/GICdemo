## Set Up an Ayurvedic Exhibition Stall

Ayurvedic exhibition stalls can be set up at any state-sponsored exhibition in Sri Lanka. To do this, you need to submit a written request to the Commissioner of Ayurveda.

The request can be made on the letterhead of a society, voluntary organization, or a letter with an official seal. It should clearly state your intention to set up an Ayurvedic exhibition stall.

Once your request is approved, you can proceed to set up the stall at the exhibition venue. This is a great opportunity to showcase Ayurvedic products, services, and practices to the public.

## Important Information

- There is no fee to set up an Ayurvedic exhibition stall.
