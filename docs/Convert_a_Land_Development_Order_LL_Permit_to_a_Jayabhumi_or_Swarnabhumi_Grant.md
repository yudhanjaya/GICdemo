## Convert a Land Development Order (LL Permit) to a Jayabhumi or Swarnabhumi Grant

The Jayabhumi and Swarnabhumi land grant programs have been temporarily suspended, and a new process will be introduced soon.

However, for those who have already received Jayabhumi or Swarnabhumi grants, the following services are available:

### 1. Transfer of Ownership After the Grantee's Demise

If the original grantee has passed away, the person(s) entitled to inherit the land can apply to have the ownership transferred to them. The eligible inheritors are:

- Spouse
- Children
- Parents
- Siblings
- Grandchildren
- Aunts and uncles (mother's and father's siblings)
- Father

Note 1: The grantee can nominate one or more persons to inherit the land. If multiple people are nominated, the land will be divided among them.

Note 2: The nominated inheritor can be changed at any time before the grantee's demise.

Note 3: Only a portion of the land cannot be transferred; the entire grant must be transferred.

### 2. Cancellation of Ownership Transfer

The transfer of ownership is automatically canceled in the following cases:

- If the original grantee gets married before the transfer is complete
- If the grantee is issued a Swarnabhumi or Jayabhumi land grant certificate instead of the original Land Development Order (LL Permit)

Please note that these changes in ownership are only valid after the grantee's demise.
