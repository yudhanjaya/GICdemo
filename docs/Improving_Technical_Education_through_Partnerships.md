## Improving Technical Education through Partnerships

The Ministry of Education is committed to enhancing the quality of technical education in Sri Lanka. To achieve this, we are building direct partnerships with key stakeholders, including the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Board of Investment, and the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA).

These partnerships will help us:

- Align technical education curricula with the needs of the industry
- Provide students with more opportunities for practical training and internships
- Facilitate the introduction of innovative teaching methods and technologies
- Ensure that technical education graduates are well-equipped to meet the demands of the job market

By working closely with the private sector and professional associations, we aim to improve the overall quality and relevance of technical education in Sri Lanka.

## Important Information

- There are no fees or deadlines associated with this initiative.
- The partnerships will be implemented across all national technical education institutions.

## What You Need

To benefit from these improvements, students and institutions do not need to prepare any additional documents or take any special actions. The Ministry of Education will be coordinating directly with the partner organizations to implement the necessary changes.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. The Ministry of Education will establish formal agreements with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Board of Investment, and the OPA.
2. Technical education institutions will work with these partner organizations to review and update their curricula and teaching methods.
3. Students will have increased opportunities to participate in industry-sponsored internships and practical training programs.
4. The Ministry will monitor the implementation of these partnerships and make adjustments as needed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students.
