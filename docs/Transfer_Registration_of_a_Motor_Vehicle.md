# Transfer Registration of a Motor Vehicle

This guide explains the process for transferring the registration of a motor vehicle to a new owner in Sri Lanka. Whether you are the current registered owner or the new owner, this information will help you understand the steps and requirements to complete the transfer.

The transfer of a motor vehicle registration is a legal process that must be completed whenever ownership changes. This ensures the government's records are up to date and the new owner is properly registered as the vehicle's legal owner.

## Important Information

- The transfer must be completed within 42 days of the change in ownership.
- There is a registration fee to transfer the vehicle, which varies based on the vehicle type. Fees range from LKR 200 for motorcycles up to LKR 1,750 for priority service on larger vehicles.
- The transfer can be processed at any Divisional Secretariat office or the main Department of Motor Traffic office in Colombo.

## What You Need

To transfer the registration, you'll need to provide the following documents:

- Completed MTA 6 and MTA 8 forms
- Certificate of Registration for the vehicle
- Revenue license for the current year
- Photographs of the new owner (3.5 x 2.5 cm, one certified by a Grama Niladhari/JP/executive officer)
- If the vehicle has a mortgage or absolute ownership, a letter from the relevant institution for cancellation
- If the new owner is a company, the business registration certificate

## Step-by-Step Process

1. The current registered owner should obtain the MTA 6 and MTA 8 forms.
2. The current owner should complete Part A and A1 of the MTA 6 form and send Part A to the Commissioner of Motor Traffic.
3. The current owner should give Part B and B1 of the MTA 6 and Part C and C1 of the MTA 8 to the new owner.
4. The new owner should pay the registration fee at a bank and obtain the payment voucher.
5. The new owner should submit the payment voucher, Part B of the MTA 6, and the completed Part C of the MTA 8 along with all supporting documents to the Department of Motor Traffic.
6. The new owner should obtain a receipt (CMT 52) from the main office in Colombo for priority service.
7. The new owner should retain Part B1 of the MTA 6 and Part C1 of the MTA 8.
8. Once the documents are verified, the Department of Motor Traffic will issue the transferred Certificate of Registration.
