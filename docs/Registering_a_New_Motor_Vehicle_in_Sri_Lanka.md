- Application for a certificate of weight of the motor vehicle (form "C.M.T. 130")
- Photocopy of your National Identity Card, Driving License, or Passport

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Obtain the "M.T.A. 2" application form from the Department of Motor Traffic or online.
2. Fill out the application form and submit it to the Commissioner of the Registering Division.
3. Pay the registration fee at a bank and obtain the payment voucher.
4. Submit the payment voucher to the counter at the Department of Motor Traffic.
5. The department will issue approval for the insurance policy and road tax.
