## Eliminate Restrictive Trade Agreements Among Traders

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) can help eliminate restrictive trade agreements that negatively impact consumers. Any trader or trader group can request the CAA to investigate and take action against anticompetitive agreements.

The CAA will study the complaint, invite the traders involved to get their views, and if the agreement is found to be harmful to consumers, instruct the traders to eliminate the restrictive practices.

### What You Need to Know

- There is no application form - you can submit a request through a letter to the Director General of the CAA.
- The CAA will investigate the complaint and make a decision within 2 months.
- If the CAA finds the agreement to be anticompetitive, they will give the traders 1 month to eliminate the restrictive practices.
- The service is free of charge, and there are no fines or penalties involved.
- If you disagree with the CAA's decision, you can appeal to the Court of Appeal.

### How to Request Elimination of a Restrictive Agreement

1. Submit a written complaint to the Director General of the Consumer Affairs Authority, detailing the restrictive trade agreement and how it negatively impacts you or your business.
2. The CAA will review the complaint and invite the traders involved to get their perspective.
3. If the CAA determines the agreement is anticompetitive, they will instruct the traders to eliminate the restrictive practices within 1 month.
4. The CAA's decision can be appealed to the Court of Appeal if you disagree with the outcome.
