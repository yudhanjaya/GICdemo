# Sit for Exams and Obtain Certificates in Sri Lanka

This guide explains the process for students to sit for exams and obtain certificates from the Department of Technical Education and Training in Sri Lanka. It covers final exams for full-time, part-time, and short-term courses, as well as exams for students in National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) programs and staff from other organizations.

## Final Exams for Full-Time and Part-Time Courses

Applications for final exams are handled at the college level for students who have completed full-time or part-time courses. The exams are organized, supervised, and evaluated by the Testing and Evaluation Division of the Department. Certificates are issued to students who pass the exams, provided they have attended at least 80% of classes and have the recommendation of the college principal.

## Exams for National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Courses

The practical exams for students who have completed NVQ courses are conducted by assessors under the supervision and coordination of the Testing and Evaluation Division and the Director/Principal of the Colleges of Technology/Technical Colleges. The Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission then issues the relevant NVQ certificates based on the exam results.

## Final Exams for Short-Term Courses

Final exams for students who have completed short-term courses are held at the Technical College level under the supervision of the Director (Testing and Evaluation). Certificates are issued by the Testing and Evaluation Division of the Department to qualified students.

## Exams for Staff of Other Organizations

The Department's Director (Testing and Evaluation) supervises exams held for staff of other organizations, and the Testing and Evaluation Division issues the certificates.
