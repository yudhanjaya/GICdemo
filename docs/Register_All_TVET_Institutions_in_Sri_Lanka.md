# Register All TVET Institutions in Sri Lanka

This guide explains the process for registering all tertiary and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions in Sri Lanka. Registration is a legal requirement under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Act No. 20 of 1990.

TVET institutions cannot be established, managed, run, or controlled without being registered under this act. The Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) has been responsible for registering TVET institutions since 1990.

## Important Information

- Registration is required for all TVET institutions in Sri Lanka.
- Institutions are registered in one of four categories: A+, A, B, or C.
- Registration is valid for 2-3 years, depending on the category.
- Institutions must renew their registration before it expires.
- There are registration fees ranging from LKR 1,000 to LKR 3,000, depending on the category.
