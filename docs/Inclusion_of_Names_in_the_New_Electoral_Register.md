## Inclusion of Names in the New Electoral Register

This guide explains the process for citizens to have their names included in the new electoral register in Sri Lanka. The electoral register is the official list of eligible voters, and it is updated annually.

If your name is not on the current electoral register, or if you have recently moved to a new address, you can follow these steps to get your name added.

## Important Information

- The electoral register is updated annually, with the process starting in November/December each year.
- There is a 28-day period during which the current "A" and "B" lists are displayed for public review.
- During this time, you can submit a claim to have your name included or to make an objection.
- All services related to voter registration are provided free of charge.
- There are no penalties for failing to submit your registration form, but you will not be able to vote until the next annual update.

## What You Need

To submit a claim or objection, you will need:

- Birth certificate
- National identity card
- Declaration statement from your Grama Niladari (village officer)

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Check the current "A" and "B" lists displayed at the district office and post offices to see if your name is included.
2. If your name is not on the list, you can request the appropriate form (A, B, C, or D) from the same locations.
3. Fill out the form and submit it to the Assistant Commissioner of Elections (at the district level), the Registration Officer, or your Grama Niladari.
4. You will be called for an interview with the examiners, where you will need to provide your supporting documents.
5. The examiner (Assistant Commissioner of Elections or Registration Officer) will make a decision on your claim or objection.
6. If your claim is approved, your name will be included in the updated electoral register.
7. The revised electoral registers are finalized and certified by May of the following year.
8. The new registers are then made available to the public and used for all elections until the next annual update.
