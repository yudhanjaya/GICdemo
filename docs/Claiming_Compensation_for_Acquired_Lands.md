Claiming Compensation for Acquired Lands

If the government has acquired your land or property for urban development, you are entitled to claim compensation. This guide explains the process for owners to claim compensation from the Urban Development Authority (UDA).

The UDA is responsible for acquiring land and properties for urban development projects across Sri Lanka. If your land or property has been acquired, you can claim compensation from the UDA.

Important Information:
- You must submit your claim within 2 weeks of the land/property being acquired.
- Compensation is based on the market value of the land or property at the time of acquisition.
- There is no specific application form - you can submit a letter to claim compensation.

What You Need:
- Your National Identity Card or equivalent identification document
- Proof of ownership of the land or property (e.g., title deed, deed of transfer)

Step-by-Step Process:
1. Write a letter to the UDA claiming compensation for the acquired land or property.
2. Submit the letter, along with your identification and ownership documents, to the UDA office during regular business hours (9 AM to 4 PM, Monday to Friday).
3. The UDA will assess your claim and determine the appropriate compensation amount based on the market value.
4. The UDA will inform you of the compensation amount and arrange for payment.
