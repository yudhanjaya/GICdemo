## Obtain Preliminary Planning Clearance for Hotel Projects

If you are planning to develop a hotel project in Sri Lanka, you need to obtain preliminary planning clearance from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) before proceeding with your project.

  - Large-scale projects (above LKR 50 million): LKR 150,000 + VAT + NBT
- The application process takes approximately 3 weeks to complete.
