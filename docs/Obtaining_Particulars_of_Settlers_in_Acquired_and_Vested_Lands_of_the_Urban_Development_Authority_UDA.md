If you need land or property that has been acquired or vested with the Urban Development Authority (UDA), you can obtain the particulars of the settlers living on that land. This guide explains the process to get this information.

The UDA is responsible for acquiring and managing land for urban development projects in Sri Lanka. If your property has been acquired or vested with the UDA, you can request information about the settlers currently living on that land.

To get the particulars of settlers, you will need to submit a letter to the UDA's Land Development and Management Division. There is no specific application form for this request.
