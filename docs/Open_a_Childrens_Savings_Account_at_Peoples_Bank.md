## Open a Children's Savings Account at People's Bank

People's Bank offers two types of children's savings accounts - Isuru Udana and Sisu Udana. These accounts are designed to help parents and guardians save for their children's future.

Isuru Udana is for infants up to 5 years old, while Sisu Udana is for school-aged children from 5 to 18 years old. Both accounts can be opened with a minimum deposit of LKR 100.

### Important Information

- Isuru Udana accounts come with "Isuru Udana" gift certificates that can be used to open the account or credited to the account.
- Sisu Udana accounts offer exciting gifts based on the account balance and a special cash award for children who excel in their O/Levels and A/Levels.
- Both accounts earn interest on the daily balance.
