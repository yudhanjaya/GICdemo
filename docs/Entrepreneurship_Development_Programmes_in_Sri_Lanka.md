## Entrepreneurship Development Programmes in Sri Lanka

The Carrier Guidance Unit of the Ministry of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations offers entrepreneurship development programmes to support individuals who have completed vocational education and youth who wish to start or are already engaged in self-employment.

The key components of the entrepreneurship development programmes are:

### 1. Awareness Programmes
Awareness programmes on entrepreneurship development are conducted for all students studying at Colleges of Technology and Technical Colleges.

### 2. Entrepreneurship Training
After the awareness programmes, a 14-day entrepreneurship training programme is offered for students who wish to become entrepreneurs.

### 3. Loan Assistance
The Carrier Guidance Unit assists trained entrepreneurs in obtaining the required loans to start or expand their businesses.

A guideline for entrepreneurship development is published by the Skills Development Project. For further clarifications, you can contact the Carrier Guidance Unit at the nearest College of Technology or Technical College.
