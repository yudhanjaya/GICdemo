## Obtain a New Birth Certificate from the Divisional Secretariat

If you need to obtain a new birth certificate or a copy of an existing birth certificate, you can apply at the Divisional Secretariat office. This guide explains the process step-by-step.

## Important Information

- You must apply within 3 months of the birth.
- The initial registration is free. After 3 months, there is a fee of LKR 1/- for a new certificate or a duplicate.
- If you apply more than a year after the birth, the fee is LKR 5/-.

## What You Need

To apply for a new birth certificate, you'll need to provide the following documents:

- Application form (available at the Divisional Secretariat office)
- Birth notification issued by the Grama Niladhari
- Marriage certificate of the parents
- Birth certificates of the child's siblings (if any)
- Certificate from the place of birth
- Child's vaccination card
- Report from the Public Health Inspector
- Mother's medical report (if available)
- Child's name
- School records (if the child is enrolled in school)

If you are unable to provide any of the required documents due to special circumstances, the Divisional Secretariat can still issue the birth certificate after reviewing your case.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Obtain the application form from the inquiry counter or the Registrar at the Divisional Secretariat office during office hours.

2. Fill out the application form completely.

3. Gather all the required supporting documents.

4. Submit the completed application form and documents by post or in person to the Divisional Secretariat office.

5. The birth certificate will be sent to you by post.

Note:
- If the application is rejected, the Divisional Secretariat will return the application form to you with the reason for rejection.
- If the applicant is a Sri Lankan citizen born within the relevant Divisional Secretariat area, the birth certificate can be obtained legally from the Divisional Secretariat office.
