## Importing Helicopters, Aircraft, and Spare Parts

This guide explains the process for importing helicopters, aircraft, and spare parts into Sri Lanka. This service is currently only available to the Sri Lanka Air Force.

To import these items, you must have:
- Recommendation from the Ministry of Defence
- Tender Board approval (certified copy)
- External Resources approval
- Valid invoices

## What You Need

Before you apply, you'll need to prepare the following documents:

- Application Form
- Specimen Indent Form
- Tender Board approval (certified copy)
- External Resources approval
- Valid invoices

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Submit the completed Application Form and all supporting documents to Unit 2.
2. Unit 2 will review the documents and check the licensing details.
3. With the Assistant Controller's approval, Unit 2 will debit the imported aircraft mentioned in the license.
4. The debit documents will be given to the applicant, with one copy kept for office use.

## Additional Information

- If the applicant has not followed the licensing conditions, an additional licensing fee may be charged by the Assistant Controller.
- If the import value exceeds the licensing value, the applicant must pay the additional fee with the approval of the Import/Export Controller.
- If the import period does not match the licensing period, the applicant must request an amendment to the license.
- If the imported aircraft does not match the licensed aircraft, an amended license must be obtained.
