The Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a service provided by the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) to issue National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) certificates to individuals who have acquired skills and knowledge through work experience or informal training, but do not have formal qualifications.

This service is available for Sri Lankan citizens who wish to have their existing skills and knowledge formally recognized through an NVQ certification. The RPL process allows you to obtain an NVQ certificate without having to undergo a full training program.

## Important Information

- The RPL assessment is free of charge for the first attempt.
- If you need to retake the assessment, there is a fee of LKR 1,500.
- The RPL assessment process takes approximately 4-6 weeks to complete.
