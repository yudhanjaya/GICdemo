## Register a Past Death in Sri Lanka

If a death has not been registered within 3 months of its occurrence, it can still be registered, as long as it has been less than 25 years since the death occurred. This process is known as registering a "past death."

Only certain people are eligible to register a past death:
- A close relative who was present at the time of death or cared for the deceased person during their final illness
- Any other interested party

## What You Need

To register a past death, you will need to submit the following:

- A completed Declaration Form (B15)
    - This form can be obtained from any Divisional Secretariat office
    - It must be filled out by a close relative or other interested party
    - The form requires details about the deceased person and the circumstances of their death

## Registration Process

1. Gather the required Declaration Form (B15) and any supporting documents.
2. Visit the nearest Divisional Secretariat office.
3. Submit the completed Declaration Form and pay the registration fee of LKR 50.
4. The Divisional Secretariat office will process your application and issue a death certificate.
