## Apply for a Police Clearance Certificate to Seek Employment in Sri Lanka

If you are a Sri Lankan citizen living abroad and want to seek employment in Sri Lanka, you will need to obtain a Police Clearance Certificate. This certificate confirms that you have no criminal record and are eligible for employment in the country.

The process to apply for the Police Clearance Certificate involves submitting an application through the Sri Lankan diplomatic mission in the country where you currently reside. The certificate is then issued by the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters.

## Important Information

- Countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States, and New Zealand require a Police Clearance Certificate covering the last 10 years before you left Sri Lanka.
- For other countries, the local police station in Sri Lanka where you last resided can issue the certificate.
- There is no fee charged for the application form or the certificate itself.

## What You Need

To apply for the Police Clearance Certificate, you will need to provide the following:

- Completed application form (DOP APCC)
- Copy of your passport
- Proof of your current address abroad

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Obtain the application form (DOP APCC) from the Sri Lankan diplomatic mission in the country where you currently reside.
2. Complete the application form and submit it to the Sri Lankan diplomatic mission.
3. The Sri Lankan diplomatic mission will forward your application and any required payment to the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters.
4. The Police Headquarters will request a clearance report from the local police station in Sri Lanka where you last resided.
5. If you have lived in multiple locations in Sri Lanka, the Police Headquarters will request clearance reports from all the relevant police stations.
6. The Police Headquarters will also verify your details with the Criminal Investigation Department, Director of Internal Intelligence, and the National Identity Card Department.
7. Once the verification process is complete, the Police Headquarters will issue the Police Clearance Certificate and send it back to the Sri Lankan diplomatic mission.
8. The Sri Lankan diplomatic mission will then provide the certificate to you.
