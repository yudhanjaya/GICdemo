This guide explains how to claim your Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) benefits if your government corporation or statutory board is being restructured, nationalized, or closed down.

You may be eligible to claim your EPF benefits if your workplace is:

- Being taken over by the government
- Converted from a government-owned business to a public company
- Undergoing restructuring or nationalization
- Closing down

To claim your EPF benefits in these situations, you must first obtain approval from the Commissioner General of Labour before leaving your job. Benefits will only be paid to employees who have this prior approval.

## What You Need

To apply for your EPF benefits, you'll need to submit the following:

- Completed "K" form (available at labour offices or online at labourdept.gov.lk)
- Your EPF membership "B" cards
- A copy of your National Identity Card certified by your employer
- A copy of your bank passbook

## How to Apply

1. Complete the "K" form and have Part II certified by your employer.
2. Submit the completed form and supporting documents to your nearest District Labour Office or Labour Sub-Office during regular business hours.
3. Your application will be processed within 3 weeks if all documents are in order.
