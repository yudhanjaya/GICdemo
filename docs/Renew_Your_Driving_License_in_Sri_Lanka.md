## Renew Your Driving License in Sri Lanka

If your driving license is about to expire, you can renew it through the Department of Motor Traffic. This process allows you to continue driving legally in Sri Lanka.

You can apply for a renewal if you currently hold a valid license for lorries or buses. The license must be registered in the department's system (issued after 1996) or in their manual files (issued before 1996).

## Important Information

- You must apply for renewal before your license expires.
- The renewal fee is:
    - LKR 320 for normal service (3-month processing time)
    - LKR 370 for priority service (1-day processing)
- There are no additional penalties or surcharges.

## What You Need

To renew your driving license, you'll need to provide:

- Your existing driving license
- A valid passport, including a photocopy of the page with your NIC number
- Two passport-sized photos (black and white, 2"x2")
- A medical certificate from the CTB Medical Institute

If applying for priority service, you'll also need a letter from your Grama Niladhari or Regional Secretary confirming your address.

## Renewal Process

1. Obtain the "M.T.A. 157" application form from the main Motor Traffic office in Colombo.
2. Fill out the form and submit it, along with the required documents, to the main office in Verahera, Colombo.
3. The department will issue a temporary license when they receive your application.
4. They will then verify the accuracy of your documents.
5. Once approved, the department will issue your renewed driving license.

If any documents are missing, the department will send you a letter requesting the missing requirements.
