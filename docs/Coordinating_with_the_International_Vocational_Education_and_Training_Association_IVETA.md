## Coordinating with the International Vocational Education and Training Association (IVETA)

The Ministry of Education's Technical and Vocational Education Division coordinates with the International Vocational Education and Training Association (IVETA) to enhance Sri Lanka's technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system. This collaboration aims to:

- Hold training programs and international-level conferences with IVETA
- Organize an international-level TVET conference in Sri Lanka
- Prepare a TVET journal recognized internationally

By working with IVETA, the ministry seeks to improve the quality and global recognition of Sri Lanka's TVET programs, ensuring they meet international standards and best practices.

## Key Activities

### Training Programs and International Conferences
The ministry regularly holds training programs and international-level conferences in coordination with IVETA. These events provide opportunities for Sri Lankan TVET professionals to learn from global experts, share best practices, and network with their international counterparts.

### Hosting an International TVET Conference
The ministry is in the process of preparing to host an international-level TVET conference in Sri Lanka. This conference will bring together TVET experts, policymakers, and practitioners from around the world to discuss the latest trends, challenges, and innovations in the field.

### TVET Journal Publication
