## Alter Information in a Birth Certificate

This guide explains how to alter information in a birth certificate in Sri Lanka. This process allows you to correct errors or update details on your birth certificate.

You can alter the following information on a birth certificate:
- Date and place of birth (cage 01)
- Sex (cage 03) 
- Mother's name (if it has changed since registration, cage 05)
- Informant's information (cage 09)

## What You Need

To apply for an alteration, you'll need:

- Completed declaration form B37A ([download PDF](/gic/pdf/b37a.pdf))
- Certified copy of the birth certificate to be amended
- Supporting documents, such as:
    - Parents' marriage certificate
    - Birth certificates of siblings
    - Hospital/midwife records
    - School records
    - Electoral register entry

## How to Apply

1. Take the completed declaration form B37A and supporting documents to the Additional District Registrar at the Divisional Secretariat office where the birth was originally registered.

2. Submit the application and pay the LKR 50 fee.
