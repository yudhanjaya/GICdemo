## Protect Your Musical Compositions with Legal Copyright

The Public Performances Board Ordinance has been updated to provide legal protection for songs and safeguard the rights and authority of musical composers. In parallel, the Intellectual Property Ordinance was introduced to ensure royalties are paid when songs are broadcast through media, recognizing the rights of the composition's creator.

## Important Information

- Royalties must be paid when songs are broadcast or performed publicly.
- The State Music Board oversees the administration of these laws.

## What You Need

To protect your musical compositions:
- Ensure your songs are registered with the State Music Board.
- Provide details about the composition, including the title, lyrics, and composer information.
- The registration process takes approximately 2-3 weeks.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Contact the State Music Board to initiate the registration process.
2. Submit the required information about your musical composition.
3. The State Music Board will review your application and issue a certificate of copyright registration.
4. This registration grants you legal protection and the right to receive royalties when your work is used.
