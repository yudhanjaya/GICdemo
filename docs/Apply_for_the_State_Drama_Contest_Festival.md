## Apply for the State Drama Contest & Festival

The State Drama Contest & Festival is an annual event organized by the Department of Cultural Affairs to recognize and promote high-quality Sinhala drama productions in Sri Lanka. If your drama has been publicly performed in the past year, you can apply to have it considered for the festival.

## Important Information

- Dramas must have been publicly performed for a minimum of 1 hour and a maximum of 2 hours (excluding intermission) between January 1 and December 31 of the previous year.

- Proof of the drama's public performance, such as:
  - Posters
  - Tickets

If the script writer or translator is not the drama's producer, you'll also need to submit a letter from them authorizing you to follow the festival's rules and regulations.
