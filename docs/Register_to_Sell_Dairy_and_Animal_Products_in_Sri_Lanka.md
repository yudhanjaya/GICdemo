## Register to Sell Dairy and Animal Products in Sri Lanka

This guide explains the process for registering to sell fresh milk and other dairy and animal products in Sri Lanka. Whether you are a farmer, distributor, or retailer, you must register with the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) before selling these products.

The registration process ensures that all dairy and animal product sales meet health and safety standards. By registering, you can legally sell your products across the country.

## Key Requirements

To register, you must:

- Submit a deposit
- Provide a photograph of your selling area
- Pass an inspection of your sales location

The NLDB will review your application and issue a registration certificate if your premises meet the necessary conditions.

## What You Need to Apply

To apply for registration, you will need to provide the following:

- Completed application form
- Photograph of your sales area
- Copy of your National Identity Card

The application form can be obtained from the NLDB head office in Narahenpita. 

## Application Process

1. Obtain the application form from the NLDB head office during business hours (8:30 AM to 4:15 PM, Monday to Friday).

2. Complete the form and attach the required documents, including a photograph of your sales area.

3. Submit the application in person at the NLDB head office.

4. The NLDB will inspect your sales location to ensure it meets health and safety standards.

5. If approved, you will receive a registration certificate that allows you to legally sell dairy and animal products.

The entire process typically takes several weeks, depending on the application backlog. There is no priority service available.
