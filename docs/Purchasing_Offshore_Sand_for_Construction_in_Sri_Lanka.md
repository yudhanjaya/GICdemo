## Purchasing Offshore Sand for Construction in Sri Lanka

Due to the recent growth in the construction industry, the demand for fine aggregates like sand has escalated rapidly in Sri Lanka. River sand has been the most widely used fine aggregate, but over-exploitation has led to various environmental problems such as increased river bed depth, lowered water tables, and saltwater intrusion.

To address these issues, the government has imposed restrictions on river sand extraction, leading to price increases and supply challenges for the construction industry. As a solution, the Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation (SLLRDC) has launched a project to provide offshore sand to the market at reasonable prices, helping to protect the environment and sustain the construction industry.

## Offshore Sand Sales Locations and Pricing

The SLLRDC has established four sales outlets for offshore sand:

Location | Telephone | Price per Cube
--- | --- | ---
Muthurajawela (Wattala) | 011-3193130 | Rs 4,800
Mudun Ela (Kelaniya) | 011-2875336 | Rs 5,500
Kirimandala Mawatha (Nawala) | 011-2908196 | Rs 5,900
Attidiya (Dehiwala) | 011-3084465 | Rs 6,400

Additionally, sieved sand is available at the Muthurajawela outlet for Rs 6,400 per cube. All prices are subject to a royalty fee of Rs 190 per cube.

## Sand Quality and Testing

The offshore sand provided by the SLLRDC has been tested and meets the technical parameters specified in Sri Lanka Standard 1397:2010 for Fine Aggregates for Concrete and Mortar. Key test results are as follows:

Technical Parameter | Admissible Limit (SLS 1397:2010) | Test Results
--- | --- | ---
Fines | 3.0% | 1.18% - 1.33%
Water Soluble Chloride Ion Content | 0.01% by mass | 0.0004% - 0.0005%
Acid Soluble Sulphates | 0.20% by mass | 0.016% - 0.038%
Total Sulphur | 1.00% by mass | 0.03% - 0.131%
Shell Content | 15.00% by mass | 7.45%

Detailed test reports from SLLRDC, ITI, and NBRO laboratories are available for review.
