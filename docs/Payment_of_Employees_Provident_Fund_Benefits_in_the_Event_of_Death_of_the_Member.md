In the event of the death of an Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) member, their heirs can claim the EPF benefits. This guide explains the process to apply for and receive these benefits.

If the member is unmarried, the EPF benefits will be paid to their nominated beneficiaries. If there are no nominees, the benefits will be paid to the member's legal heirs.

If the member is married, the EPF benefits will be paid to the valid nominee. If there is no nominee, the benefits will be paid to the spouse and/or children of the deceased member.

To apply for the EPF death benefits, you will need to submit the following:

- Completed "L" form (available from the EPF office or website)
- Death certificate of the EPF member
- Copies of the National Identity Cards of the member and their heirs
- Any other documents requested based on the specific case

The completed application form should be submitted to the nearest District Labour Office or Labour Sub-Office during regular business hours.

The processing time for the EPF death benefits is approximately 1 month, provided all required documents are submitted.
