## Prepare and Update Vocational Education Training (VET) Plans

The Tertiary & Vocational Education Commission is responsible for providing strategic advice to training providers about the future needs of the training system. To fulfill this role, the Commission develops VET plans that detail the strategies, priority areas, and specific initiatives for training people to meet the skills requirements of different industries and the economy.

## Important Information

- VET plans have been developed for 17 key industry sectors, including Textile & Garments, Gems & Jewellery, Construction, Hotel & Tourism, and ICT.
- The training activities proposed in these VET plans are being implemented with financial assistance from the TVEC's grant scheme, which prioritizes funding for public sector training institutions.

## Procedure for Developing VET Plans

1. Identify priority industry areas based on economic and social indicators.
2. Call for proposals from lead agencies to develop, revise, or update VET plans.
3. Evaluate proposals and select a suitable agency to prepare the VET plans.
4. Obtain approval from the Tertiary & Vocational Education Commission.
5. Sign an agreement and commence the study.
6. Monitor the progress according to the action plan and timeline.
7. Make payments according to the agreement.
8. Select and obtain approval for the validation process.
9. Validate the draft VET plan through a committee.
10. Obtain Commission approval for the validated plan.
11. Distribute the VET plan to lead training providers, industry bodies, associations, the Central Bank, and relevant ministries.
