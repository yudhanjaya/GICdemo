## Apply for a Residence Visa (RV) in Sri Lanka

The Department of Commerce (DOC) is the authorized agency to issue recommendations for Residence Visas (RV) to expatriates employed by Liaison Offices, Branch Offices of foreign companies, and Trade & Commercial ventures under the purview of the Ministry of Export Development and International Trade.

If your company or organization wants to hire a foreign national, you must make a request to the Department of Emigration & Immigration before the expatriate's arrival. This request should include details like the employee's name, nationality, duration of stay, and the nature of their assignment, along with a recommendation from the line ministry. The Department of Commerce will then inform the relevant Sri Lankan mission abroad to issue a 30-day Entry Visa, with instructions for the applicant to apply for a longer-duration RV upon arrival.

For RV renewals, the applicant must make a request to the Director General of Commerce, providing adequate justification for the employee's continued stay in Sri Lanka.
