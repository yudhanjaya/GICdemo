## Soil Testing Service for Farmers in Sri Lanka

This guide explains the soil testing service provided by the Department of Agriculture to help farmers understand the fertility of their soil and get recommendations for proper fertilizer application.

The soil testing service is available to all farmers and interested individuals across Sri Lanka. It is a valuable tool for improving crop yields and maintaining soil health.

## Important Information

- The soil testing service is free of charge for the first sample. After that, there is a fee of LKR 290 per sample.
- Soil samples must be collected and submitted through the local Agriculture Instructor (AI) attached to the Provincial Agriculture Department or Inter Provincial Extension Service.
- It takes 3-4 weeks to receive the soil test report and fertilizer recommendation after the sample is received by the laboratory.

- Your contact information (name, address, phone number)
- Details about your land (location, crop type, cultivation history)
- A soil sample collected from your field, following the instructions provided by the AI.

The AI will assist you in collecting the soil sample properly and submit it to the laboratory on your behalf.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Contact your local Agriculture Instructor (AI) and request a soil test.
2. The AI will visit your field and collect a soil sample according to the proper procedures.
3. The AI will submit the soil sample to the Soil Fertility Division laboratory.
