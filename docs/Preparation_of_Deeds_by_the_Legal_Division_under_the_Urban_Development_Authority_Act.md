The Urban Development Authority (UDA) provides a service to prepare deeds for land transactions under Section 18(1) of the UDA Act. This service is available to anyone who needs to have a deed prepared for land acquired or transferred under the UDA's authority.

The key information you need to know about this service is:

- **Deadlines**: There are no specific deadlines to obtain this service, but the process can take up to 3 weeks to complete.
- **Costs**: There is no fee charged for the deed preparation service itself. However, you will need to pay the relevant stamp duty and other charges when the deed is registered.
- **Where to go**: Visit the Legal Division of the UDA during regular business hours (9 AM to 4 PM, Monday to Friday) to initiate the deed preparation process.

To get your deed prepared, you will need to provide the following:

- Honorable Minister's approval
- Approval of the Cabinet
- Approval of the UDA Board of Management
- Certificate of Land Acquisition
- Plans and list of land allotments
- Receipt of payment for the land

Once you have submitted all the required documents, the UDA's Legal Division will prepare the deed. They will then send the deed to you for registration, which you can complete by paying the necessary stamp duty and other fees.
