## Disseminating Early Warnings for Disasters in Sri Lanka

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) is the main agency responsible for coordinating and disseminating early warnings for natural and man-made disasters in Sri Lanka. The DMC's Multi Hazard Early Warning Dissemination Division works closely with technical agencies to monitor hazards and communicate urgent warnings to vulnerable communities.

## Key Responsibilities

The DMC's key responsibilities in early warning dissemination include:

- Maintaining and operating early warning towers and other dissemination equipment
- Coordinating the dissemination of early warning messages to ensure they reach remote, vulnerable communities
- Collaborating with technical agencies to strengthen their capacity for early warning
- Developing strategies and policies for effective early warning systems
- Raising awareness about early warning activities among agencies and the public
- Guiding district and local disaster management units in implementing warning dissemination

## Coordination and Communication

The DMC establishes coordination with local technical agencies responsible for forecasting different hazards. It also sets up reliable communication systems, such as telephones and radio, to transmit warnings from these agencies to the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and provincial/district control rooms.

The DMC ensures redundancy by having alternative communication systems in place in case of breakdowns in the main system. It also works with media outlets to disseminate information to the public.

## Community Awareness

The DMC creates awareness among communities and stakeholders, including the police, about the communication systems used for early warning and the immediate actions to be taken, especially for rapid-onset disasters.

## Multi-Hazard Early Warning Tower Locations

The DMC has installed early warning towers at 41 locations across Sri Lanka to disseminate alerts for various hazards. These towers are located in the following districts:
