The SLS Certification Mark is a third-party guarantee of product quality in Sri Lanka. Manufacturers who produce goods conforming to Sri Lanka Standards can apply for a permit to use the "SLS" mark on their products. This guide explains how to obtain a permit to use the SLS Certification Mark.

## Important Information

- The SLS Mark has been made compulsory for certain products through government regulations.
- There is an annual fee to use the SLS Certification Mark, based on the sales value of the product.

To apply for a permit, you'll need to provide the following:

- Completed application form

- Outline of your manufacturing process
- Test certificates showing your product conforms to the relevant Sri Lanka Standard
- Details of any other product or system certifications you hold
- Application fee of USD 25 or equivalent

## Step-by-Step Process
