## Register Your Fruit Plant Nursery in Sri Lanka

If you operate a fruit plant nursery in Sri Lanka, you need to register it with the Department of Agriculture's Seed Certification Service (SCS) and get your planting materials certified. This ensures the quality and traceability of the fruit plants you sell.

## Important Information

- Registration fee: LKR 290 per nursery, paid annually
- Certification fee: LKR 1.50 per certified plant label
- You must have at least 500 plants in your nursery at the time of inspection.
- Registered nurseries must maintain at least 1,000 plants per year to continue their registration.

## What You Need

To register your nursery, you'll need to provide:
- Proof of ownership or lease of the nursery land (minimum 1/8 acre)
- Evidence of access to water, transportation, and necessary knowledge

## How to Register Your Nursery

1. Obtain an application form from the SCS headquarters or regional offices.
2. Submit the completed application to the Agricultural Instructor (AI) in your area.
