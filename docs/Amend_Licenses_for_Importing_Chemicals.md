## Amend Licenses for Importing Chemicals

As an importer, you are allowed up to nine amendments to your license for importing chemicals, insecticides, and pesticides. You can amend your license to:

- Postpone the time period
- Increase the value of the licensed goods
- Change the invoice types

You must obtain an amended license for any changes to your original import license.

## Important Information

- You must have a valid license for importing insecticides and pesticides.
- You are allowed up to nine amendments to your license.
- If your import has exceeded the time period in the license, you must obtain a clearance letter from the relevant authority.

## What You Need

To apply for an amendment, you will need to provide:

- A written request letter
- Supporting documents, such as:
    - Letter explaining the reason for the delay (if applicable)
    - Letter of approval from the relevant authority (if applicable)
    - Invoices for the amended goods

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Submit a written request to Unit 3 of the Department of Import and Export Control.
2. Unit 3 will consider your request.
3. If it's a time amendment, you must submit a letter explaining the delay.
4. The Assistant Controller will approve the amendment.
5. The amendments will be made to your license.

If it's not a time amendment, you can submit the supporting documents directly to Unit 3, and the Assistant Controller will approve the amendment.

The entire process takes one day.
