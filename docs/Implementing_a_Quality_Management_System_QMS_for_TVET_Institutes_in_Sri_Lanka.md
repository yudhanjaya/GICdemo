## Implementing a Quality Management System (QMS) for TVET Institutes in Sri Lanka

As a prime requirement, the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) is responsible for assuring the quality and relevance of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) sector in Sri Lanka. To achieve this objective, TVEC registers TVET institutes and accredits their training programs.

TVET institutes registered with TVEC and conducting accredited training courses are expected to implement and maintain a specified Quality Management System (QMS), which is the ISO 9001:2000 standard. TVEC is making arrangements to award the ISO 9001:2000 certification to assist the institutes in continuously improving their processes to achieve customer (student/trainee and employer) satisfaction.

## Important Information

- TVET institutes must be registered with TVEC to operate in Sri Lanka.
- TVET institutes conducting accredited training courses must implement and maintain the ISO 9001:2000 QMS.
- TVEC provides assistance to TVET institutes in obtaining the ISO 9001:2000 certification.

## What You Need

To implement the QMS, TVET institutes must:
- Understand the requirements of the ISO 9001:2000 standard
- Develop and document their quality management processes
- Train staff on the QMS
- Undergo an audit by TVEC to obtain the ISO 9001:2000 certification

## Step-by-Step Process

1. TVET institute registers with TVEC.
2. TVEC assesses the institute's readiness to implement the QMS.
3. The institute develops and documents its quality management processes according to the ISO 9001:2000 standard.
4. The institute trains its staff on the QMS.
5. TVEC conducts an audit of the institute's QMS implementation.
6. TVEC awards the ISO 9001:2000 certification to the institute upon successful completion of the audit.
