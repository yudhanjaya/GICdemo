# Reporting a Missing Driving License in Sri Lanka

If your driving license has been lost or stolen, you need to report it to the police and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to get a replacement. This guide explains the step-by-step process.

## What You Need to Do

1. Visit your nearest police station and file a complaint about your missing driving license. The police will issue you an extract of the complaint form.

2. Take the extract of the complaint form to the DMV office. You'll need to fill out an application form provided by the DMV and submit it along with the extract.

3. The DMV will verify the complaint with the police station before processing your application for a replacement driving license.

4. Once your application is approved, you can collect your new driving license from the DMV office.

## What to Prepare

To apply for a replacement driving license, you'll need to provide the following:

- Extract of the police complaint form
- Your previous driving license number (if available)
- Your National Identity Card (NIC) number
- Your passport number (if applicable)

The police station will charge you LKR 25 per page for the extract of the complaint form.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Visit your nearest police station and inform them that your driving license is missing. The police officer will take your statement and issue you an extract of the complaint form (DOP F424).

2. Take the extract of the complaint form to the nearest DMV office.

3. At the DMV office, fill out the application form for a replacement driving license. Attach the extract of the complaint form and any other required documents.

4. The DMV officer will verify the details of your complaint with the police station before processing your application.

5. Once your application is approved, you can collect your new driving license from the DMV office.
