## Post-Harvest Practices for Export Agricultural Crops in Sri Lanka

This guide explains the post-harvest technical assistance programs offered by the Department of Export Agriculture to help improve the quality of Sri Lanka's export agricultural crops.

The department provides investment assistance under three schemes:

1. For establishing group processing centers
2. For establishing central processing centers
3. For establishing private processing centers

### Group Processing Center Establishments

Groups eligible for assistance in establishing group processing centers include:

- Export agricultural crop cultivators' farmer organizations
- Export agricultural crop cultivating farmers in areas where "Jathika Saviya" or "Janasaba" programs are conducted

Requirements to obtain assistance:

- There must be an adequate supply of export agricultural crop harvests in the area.
- The farmer organization must be active and have sufficient funds to operate the center.
- A project report must be submitted.

Site selection and processing unit requirements:

- The location must be easily accessible.
- Processing units can be constructed on private land or government land (which must be transferred to the Department of Export Agriculture).
- Required funds for construction must be obtained from external sources.

Machinery supply and maintenance:

- Necessary machines are purchased by the department and issued to the farmer organization on a cash loan basis.
- The department retains ownership of the equipment for 5 years of supervision.
- After 5 years, if the machinery is in good condition, ownership can be transferred to the farmer organization.
- The farmer organization must maintain a fund to maintain the processing center and machinery.
- Building construction and machinery maintenance must be carried out by the farmer organization.

### Central Processing Center Establishments

The aim is to increase employment opportunities by enhancing the production and value addition of quality export agricultural crops.

Groups eligible for assistance:

- Large-scale export agricultural crop growers
- People engaged in the plantation crop sector
- Exporters, suppliers, farmer organizations, or farmers

Requirements for a central processing center:

- A project report for the proposed center
- Machinery procurement according to departmental recommendations
- Building plans can be provided by the Department of Export Agriculture
- At least 75% of the investment must be borne by the private sector

Requirements to obtain investment assistance:

- Construction of the building must be completed, and the machinery must be in proper working condition.
- An examination report from appropriate officers is required before payments are made.

Payments are approved by a board of officers appointed by the Director-General.

### Establishing Private Processing Centers

The aim is to increase the quality of export agricultural crop produce.

Registration and requirements:

- Applications can be obtained and submitted by paying a Rs. 10.00 stamp fee to the Extension Officer's office or the District Assistant Director's office.
- Written approval from the District Assistant Director is required for the satisfactory installation and operation of the unit.
- The building must have enough space to accommodate the equipment.
- Building construction must be done according to the department's plan, and prior approval must be obtained.
- Purchasing equipment and machinery without prior approval may result in the assistance being halted.

Drying process requirements:

- The drying area must be constructed to prevent the mixing of inert matter.
- The drying capacity must be a minimum of 250 kg per batch, with an area of at least 200 sq. ft.
- Solar dryers must have an area of at least 100 sq. ft. and be raised 2 feet above the ground.
- Artificial dryers (firewood/fuel/current) can also be used.

Payments are recommended and approved by a board of officers appointed by the Director-General. Requirements include:

- 2 voucher sheets
- Agreement papers
- Original copies of the bills
- For distillation units, a grant for repairs can be applied for after 5 years of receiving the first installation grant.
