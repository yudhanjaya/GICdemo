## Renew a Foreign Employment Recruitment Agency License

As a foreign employment recruitment agency, you can renew your agency license by submitting the completed application form available at the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). 

You must submit the renewal application 30 days before your current license expires. The SLBFE will then evaluate your agency's performance over the past two consecutive years. If your agency has not conducted any recruitment during this period, the renewal may not be granted.

The SLBFE will inspect your office, equipment, records, and extended bank guarantee, and then grant approval for the renewal of your license.

### What You Need to Renew Your License

To renew your license, you will need to provide the following:

- Completed renewal application form
- Proof of legal occupancy of your agency's premises
- Revised business registration certificate with the details of your new premises (if you have moved to a new location)
- Renewal fee of LKR 50,000 (excluding NBT and VAT)

### Steps to Renew Your License

1. Obtain the renewal application form from the SLBFE.
2. Complete the form and gather the required documents.
3. Submit the application and documents to the SLBFE at least 30 days before your current license expires.
