## Apply for a Block License to Import Goods

A block license allows you to import goods into Sri Lanka without applying for a separate import license for each shipment. This guide explains the process to apply for a block license.

You can apply for a block license if you regularly import goods into Sri Lanka. The block license covers multiple shipments over a one-year period.

## Important Information

- The block license is valid for 1 year.
- The license fee is 0.2% of the total invoice value of the goods you plan to import.
- If you have not followed the conditions of your previous block license, your new application may be rejected.

## What You Need

To apply for a block license, you'll need to provide:

- A request letter
- Documents showing your import history for the past 3 years
- Completed indent form

## How to Apply

1. Submit a request letter to Unit 1 of the Department of Import and Export Control.
2. Unit 1 will review your import history for the past 3 years.
3. If approved by the Assistant Controller, Unit 1 will charge the license fee of 0.2% of the total invoice value.
4. Unit 1 will then issue your block license, which is valid for 1 year.

If the Assistant Controller is not satisfied with your import history, your request will be rejected.
