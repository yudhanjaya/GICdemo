## Obtain Birth, Marriage, Hospitalization, and Death Allowances from the Samurdhi Social Protection Fund

The Samurdhi Social Protection Fund provides financial assistance to Samurdhi beneficiaries in the event of a birth, marriage, hospitalization, or death in the family. This guide explains the eligibility criteria, required documents, and step-by-step process to apply for these allowances.

## Important Information

- Beneficiaries must own a Samurdhi stamp (Rs. 1500, 900, 615, 415, or 210) to be eligible for the allowances.
- There are specific requirements and limits for each type of allowance:
  - Birth: Rs. 2,000 for the first child, Rs. 1,000 for the second child. Births by cesarean section are not eligible.
  - Marriage: Rs. 1,000 per child of the Samurdhi beneficiary.
  - Hospitalization: Rs. 100 per day, up to a maximum of 30 days. Only the Samurdhi beneficiary who generates income is eligible.
  - Death: Rs. 10,000 for the death of a family member. The funeral must be held at the beneficiary's residence, or a letter from the Grama Niladari is required.
- Applications must be submitted within 1 month of the event.

## What You Need

1. Birth:
   - Birth certificate of the child
   - Baby card/Child nutrition development card

2. Marriage:
   - Marriage certificate
   - Birth certificate of the couple

3. Hospitalization:
   - Doctor's prescription or seal

4. Death:
   - Death certificate
   - If the death certificate cannot be produced, a certification of death from the Grama Niladari or Samurdhi Development Officer is required.
   - If the death occurred during violence or argument, a letter from the Court of Law stating the deceased family member was not guilty is needed.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Submit an application to the Samurdhi Development Officer of the relevant Grama Niladari Division, stating the event (birth, death, hospitalization, or marriage).
2. Attach the required supporting documents to the application.
3. The Samurdhi Development Officer forwards the documents to the Samurdhi Division Office.
4. The Samurdhi Division Office Manager approves the application and sends it to the Divisional Secretariat.
5. The Divisional Secretariat compares the request with the member's files and approves the application, then sends it back to the Samurdhi Division Office.
6. The Samurdhi Division Office Accountant certifies the application and issues a cheque to the applicant.

If the Divisional Secretary does not approve the application, it will be rejected.
