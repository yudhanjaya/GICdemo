# Apply for an Energy Efficiency Rating Label

The Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) operates an Energy Efficiency Labeling Scheme for electrical appliances. This scheme allows importers and manufacturers to voluntarily obtain an energy efficiency rating label for their products.

The energy efficiency label helps consumers quickly understand the energy usage and environmental impact of an appliance before purchase. Appliances are assigned a star rating, with more stars indicating higher energy efficiency.

## Important Information

- The energy efficiency rating is determined based on relevant Sri Lanka Standards (SLS 1200 for Magnetic Ballasts and SLS 1225 for Compact Fluorescent Lamps).
- There is a fee of LKR 5,000 to obtain the energy efficiency certificate, valid for 3 years.
- The manufacturer or importer must bear the cost of testing and sample collection.
- The energy efficiency label must be printed and affixed to the product by the manufacturer or importer.

## What You Need

To apply for an energy efficiency rating label, you will need:

- Completed application form
- Test reports from SLSI or other recognized laboratory, demonstrating the appliance's energy efficiency

## How to Apply

1. Submit a duly completed application form to the Director (Engineering), Sri Lanka Standards Institution.
2. SLSI will test a random sample of the appliance to determine its energy efficiency rating.
3. SLSI will issue a certificate authorizing the use of the energy efficiency label, valid for 3 years.
4. The manufacturer or importer must print and affix the label to the product, ensuring traceability of each label used.
