## Stabilize Prices of Essential Commodities in Sri Lanka

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) takes measures to stabilize the prices of essential commodities at reasonable levels. This is done through the provisions granted in Sections 14, 18, and 19 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No. 9 of 2003.

When an item is specified as an essential commodity under Section 18 of the Act, importers, manufacturers, or traders must obtain prior written approval from the CAA before increasing the price of that item. The CAA can also intervene in situations of "excessive pricing" and determine a Maximum Retail Price for a commodity under Section 19 of the Act.

The items currently gazetted as essential commodities under Section 18 are:

1. Milk Powder - Full Cream
2. LPG
3. Wheat Flour
4. Cement
5. Chicken Meat
6. White Sugar
7. Dried Chilies
8. Big Onions
9. Red Onions
10. Dhal
11. Dried Sprats
12. Gram
13. Green Moong
14. Rice
15. Canned Fish

## Applying for Price Increase Approval

Any importer, manufacturer, or trader who wants to increase the price of a specified essential commodity must submit an application to the CAA for approval. The application should include:

1. A description of the item, including brand name, pack size, present price, and proposed price.
2. Reasons for the price increase.
3. A comprehensive cost structure, including a breakdown of individual cost elements for the current and proposed prices.
4. Supporting documents such as invoices, letters of credit, bills of lading, packing lists, customs declarations, and receipts for expenses.
5. Details of direct expenses, including labor and materials.
6. Analysis of indirect and overhead expenses, and the basis for allocation and recovery.
7. Company profit margins and the basis for calculation.
8. Distributor, dealer, and retailer margins.
9. Taxes and charges.
10. The latest audited financial statements.

The CAA will review the application and supporting documents and communicate its decision within 30 days, unless the applicant fails to provide the required information or assistance. In such cases, the CAA may issue an "Interim Order" prohibiting the price increase until a decision is made.

## Additional Information

- The Pricing & Management Division of the CAA is responsible for examining and approving pricing applications.
- The Pricing Committee of the CAA is the approving authority for price decisions.
- Decisions are communicated by fax and registered mail.
- There is a right of further appeal to the Court of Appeal if the applicant is not satisfied with the CAA's decision.
