## Apply for an Environmental Protection License in Sri Lanka

The Environmental Protection License (EPL) is a legal requirement under the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980 (NEA). Section 23A of the NEA states that no person shall carry out any prescribed activity without an EPL. This license authorizes industries and activities to discharge effluents, deposit wastes, emit smoke/gases/fumes/vapor, or produce excessive noise/vibration into the environment, under certain conditions.

## Important Information

- Industries and activities prescribed under Parts A, B, and C of the Gazette Notification No. 1533/16 of 25.01.2008 must obtain an EPL.
- Part A and B activities must obtain the EPL from the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) provincial or district offices.
- Part C activities must obtain the EPL from the relevant Local Authority (Municipal Council, Urban Council, or Pradeshiya Sabha).
- Industries registered under Section 17 of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Act must obtain the EPL from the BOI.
- The EPL is valid for a specific period and must be renewed before it expires.

## What You Need

To apply for an EPL, you will need to submit the following:

- Duly filled EPL application form (available at CEA offices and downloadable from www.cea.lk)
- Certificate of Business Registration
- Legal authorization to use the land for the industrial activity (deed, lease agreement, etc.)
- Copy of the land survey plan
- Legal authorization for establishing the industry at the site (Certificate of Conformity, Trade License, or Consent from the relevant Local Authority)
- Production Certificate for specific products (e.g., distilleries, medicinal products, pesticides)
- Proposal for pollutant abatement

## Application Process

1. Submit the duly filled EPL application form to the relevant authority (CEA, Local Authority, or BOI) at least 1 month (30 days) before the commencement of the prescribed activity.
2. Pay the inspection fee, which will be calculated based on the type of industry/activity.
3. The authority will conduct an inspection upon receiving the inspection fee.
4. If the waste generated does not conform to the CEA's standards, the EPL will be refused, and the applicant will be informed.
5. If the EPL is approved, the applicant must pay the license fee.
6. Once the license fee is paid, the EPL will be issued.

## Renewal Process

- Submit the duly filled EPL renewal application form to the relevant authority at least 3 months before the expiry of the current license.
- If the renewal application is not submitted on time, a fresh EPL application must be submitted, and the inspection fee will be charged.
