## Apply for Rural Development Infrastructure Projects in Sri Lanka

The Rural Development Division of the Department of Divinaguma Development implements several infrastructure development programs to improve facilities and services in rural communities across Sri Lanka. These programs provide funding and support for projects like road construction, irrigation systems, drinking water supply, and environmental protection.

If you live in a rural area and your community needs infrastructure improvements, you can apply to participate in one of these programs. The application process is managed through the Divisional Secretariat office in your area.

## Important Information

- These programs are implemented nationwide, with a target of completing 12,240 projects.
- Project costs are covered by the government, but communities are expected to contribute at least 20% of the total cost.
- The construction work is carried out by contractors, not community members.

## What You Need to Apply

To apply for an infrastructure project, you'll need to provide the following:

- A letter from the Grama Niladhari (village officer) identifying the community's needs and priorities
- Approval from the Divisional Secretary and District Secretary
- Recommendation from the local Samurdhi (poverty alleviation) Authority office

## Application Process

1. Identify the infrastructure needs in your community, such as road repairs, irrigation, drinking water, or environmental protection.
2. Discuss the project proposal with your Grama Niladhari, who will write a letter outlining the community's requirements.
3. Submit the Grama Niladhari's letter to the Divisional Secretary's office for approval.
4. The Divisional Secretary and District Secretary will review the proposal and provide their recommendations.
5. The proposal will then be forwarded to the local Samurdhi Authority office.
6. The Samurdhi Authority will evaluate the project and, if approved, oversee the implementation.
