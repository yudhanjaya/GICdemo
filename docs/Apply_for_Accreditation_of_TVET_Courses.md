## Apply for Accreditation of TVET Courses

The Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) is responsible for accrediting vocational education and training (TVET) courses conducted by registered institutes. These courses must be accredited against the National Competency Standards (NCS), which are developed based on industry requirements and labor market trends.

To get your TVET courses accredited, you need to submit an application to TVEC. This guide explains the accreditation process and what you need to prepare.

## Important Information

- The accreditation process takes approximately 12 weeks.
- There is no fee to apply for course accreditation.
