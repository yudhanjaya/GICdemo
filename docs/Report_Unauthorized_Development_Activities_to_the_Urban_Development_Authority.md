## Report Unauthorized Development Activities to the Urban Development Authority

The Urban Development Authority (UDA) is responsible for overseeing development activities in declared urban areas of Sri Lanka. If you notice any unauthorized construction, subdivision of land, or change of land use, you can report it to the UDA's Legal Division for investigation and enforcement action.

## What to Report

You can report any of the following unauthorized activities to the UDA:

- Unauthorized construction or building work
- Unauthorized subdivision or amalgamation of land
- Unauthorized change of land use

## How to Report

There are a few ways you can report an unauthorized development activity:

1. Write a letter to the UDA Legal Division with details of the violation.
2. Send a telegram or make a phone call to the Legal Division.
3. Submit an online complaint through the UDA website.

When reporting, be sure to include the following information:

- Name and address of the unauthorized developer
- Location and details of the unauthorized activity
- Any supporting documents or evidence you have

You can make anonymous complaints if you prefer.

## What Happens Next

The UDA will investigate the complaint promptly. If the activity is found to be unauthorized, the UDA will take legal action under the Urban Development Authority Act. This process is usually completed within 3 months, though timing may vary depending on court schedules.

The UDA may require the complainant to share in the costs of removing the unauthorized development, but only with the complainant's consent.
