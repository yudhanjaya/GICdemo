## Debit Goods Imported Under Licenses

This guide explains the process for debiting goods imported under a valid license issued by the Department of Import and Export Control. If you have a valid license and have imported goods, you can follow these steps to debit the imported goods against your license.

## Important Information

- You must have a valid license with the correct duration and details.
- You must comply with all the conditions of your license.

To debit your imported goods, you will need to provide the following documents:

1. Submit all the necessary supporting documents to Unit 1 at the Department of Import and Export Control.
