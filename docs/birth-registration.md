# How to Register a Birth in Sri Lanka

## What is a birth certificate?
A birth certificate is an official document that proves when and where someone was born. Everyone in Sri Lanka needs one for:
- School admission
- Getting a National Identity Card
- Applying for a passport
- Proving citizenship

## When to register
You must register the birth within 3 months. Registration is free during this time. After 3 months, you'll need to pay a fee and follow a different process (see "Registering a Late Birth" below).

## Where to register
Register at the Divisional Secretariat office for the area where the birth happened - not where you live. For example, if your baby was born at Colombo Hospital but you live in Kandy, you must register in Colombo.

## Office hours
- Divisional Secretariat offices: 8:30 AM to 3:45 PM, Monday to Friday
- Money counter closes at 3:00 PM
- Registrar's hours: 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM
- Closed on weekends and public holidays

## How to register based on where the birth happened

### If the birth happened at a hospital:
1. Get the birth report from the hospital
2. Go to the Divisional Secretariat office for that area
3. Bring these documents:
   - The hospital birth report
   - Parents' National Identity Cards (originals and copies)
   - Parents' marriage certificate (if married)
   - Parents' birth certificates
   - Filled registration form CR01 (get this at the office or download it from our website)

### If the birth happened at home:
1. Tell your Grama Niladhari within 7 days
2. The Grama Niladhari will send a report (Form B23) to the local Births and Deaths Registrar
3. Go to your local Divisional Secretariat office with:
   - Parents' National Identity Cards (originals and copies)
   - Parents' marriage certificate (if married)
   - Parents' birth certificates
   - Filled registration form CR01

### If the birth happened on a registered estate:
1. Tell the Estate Superintendent within 7 days
2. If there's no superintendent, tell your Grama Niladhari
3. The superintendent will handle the registration process
4. You'll get the certificate through the estate office

## Who can register a birth?
Any of these people can register the birth:
- The mother
- The father
- Someone who was present at the birth
- The child's guardian

## Special situations

### If the parents aren't married:
Both parents must go to the Registrar's office together to include the father's information.

### If you don't have all the information:
You can still register with basic information like the date and place of birth. The certificate will show only the information you can provide.

## Getting copies of the birth certificate

### First copy:
- Free when you register the birth
- Given to the person who registered the birth

### Additional copies:
Costs:
- Rs. 120 if you know the certificate number and registration date
- Rs. 250 if you need us to search for the record (for searches less than 2 years)

How to get copies:
1. Visit any Divisional Secretariat office
2. Fill out the application form
3. Pay the fee
4. Or apply online at https://online.ebmd.rgd.gov.lk

By post:
1. Pay the fee to Bank of Ceylon account 7039827 (Battaramulla Branch)
2. Send the bank slip, application form, and a self-addressed stamped envelope to the relevant Divisional Secretariat

## Need help?
- Visit any Divisional Secretariat office
- Bring your National Identity Card
- Staff can explain the process in person
- No appointment needed

## Important notes
- Check your certificate carefully when you receive it
- Keep it safe - getting replacements takes time and costs money
- You can get the certificate in Sinhala, Tamil, or English

## Getting translations
You can get official translations between:
- Sinhala and English
- Tamil and English

Cost: Rs. 600 per translation
Time needed: 5 working days
Apply at regional offices between 9:00 AM and 2:30 PM on working days
