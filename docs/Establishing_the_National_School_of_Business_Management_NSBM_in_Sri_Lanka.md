## Establishing the National School of Business Management (NSBM) in Sri Lanka

The National School of Business Management (NSBM) was incorporated as a degree-awarding institution under the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 on October 7, 2011. It was established as the degree-awarding school of the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM).

In 2012, during the budget proposal, the President of Sri Lanka announced the plan to establish an eco-friendly "Green University" as the first of its kind in South Asia. This university was proposed to be built on a 26-acre land in Pitipana, Homagama, with state-of-the-art facilities to accommodate over 30,000 students. The construction of this university has already begun and is expected to be completed within 730 days, making it available for students in 2016.

The NSBM currently operates a city branch at No. 309, Highlevel Road, Colombo 5, housing 4,500 students pursuing undergraduate and graduate programs authorized by the University Grants Commission and leading international universities.

This project aims to contribute to the development of Sri Lanka as a knowledge hub in Asia, as outlined in the Mahinda Chintana manifesto. The NSBM seeks to create an environment-friendly, energy-efficient, and networked knowledge-based center in Asia to support the future knowledge economy and develop a humanitarian society.
