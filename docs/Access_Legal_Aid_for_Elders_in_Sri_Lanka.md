## Access Legal Aid for Elders in Sri Lanka

Nearly 2.3 million of Sri Lanka's population are senior citizens aged 60 and above, constituting about one-fifth of the total voting population. The elderly are a valuable resource for the country, with their wealth of knowledge and experience. The Legal Aid Commission's Elders' Desk provides free legal assistance and support to destitute elders.

## Key Services Provided

The Elders' Desk offers the following services:

- Provide free legal advice on issues such as maintenance, accident claims, loss of property, pensions, and fundamental rights for destitute elders.
- Offer counseling services at Elders' Homes and Day Centers, educating Grama Niladharis, Social Service Officers, and school children on elders' rights and laws.
- Collaborate with the National Secretariat for Elders and the People's Bank to launch joint programs.
- Help elders claim their rights under the Protection of Elders' Rights Act No. 9 of 2000.
