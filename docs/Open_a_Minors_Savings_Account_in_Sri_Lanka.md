## Open a Minor's Savings Account in Sri Lanka

A minor's savings account is a bank account specifically designed for children under the age of 18 in Sri Lanka. These accounts help young people start saving and learning about financial management from an early age.

Any Sri Lankan child below the age of 18 is eligible to open a minor's savings account. The account must be transferred to the child's name once they turn 18 years old.

### Important Information

- Opening a minor's savings account is free of charge.
- The bank will issue a passbook once the account balance reaches LKR 500 or more.
- The bank may periodically provide Buhuti Gift Vouchers worth LKR 200 to the child, which should be deposited into the account within 90 days.

- Signature card with the child's information and guardian's signature
- Copy of the child's birth certificate
- Mother's, father's, or guardian's national ID, passport, or driver's license
- Cash credit slip

### Step-by-Step Process
