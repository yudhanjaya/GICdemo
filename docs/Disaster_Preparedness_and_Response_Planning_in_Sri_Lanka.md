## Disaster Preparedness and Response Planning in Sri Lanka

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) is responsible for preparing the National Disaster Management Plan and the National Emergency Operation Plan. The DMC facilitates, formulates guidelines, coordinates, directs, and monitors the preparation of disaster preparedness and response plans at the provincial, district, local authority, divisional, and Grama Niladhari levels.

Disaster preparedness and response plans must be developed at all levels to ensure timely and effective response, equitable relief distribution, speedy recovery, and timely rehabilitation and reconstruction in the event of a disaster. This is required by the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act and the National Disaster Management Policy.

The organizational model emphasizes coordination rather than command and control, although command and control will be applicable within the government hierarchy of each agency. Assignment of functions and responsibilities and effective inter-agency coordination will be the key feature.

For coordination and command & control, a coordination structure is needed. While the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Resources / DMC will be the overall coordinating authority, Provincial Disaster Management Coordinating Units (PDMCUs) and District Disaster Management Coordinating Units (DDMCUs) will be the focal points for coordinating at the provincial, district, division, local authority, and Grama Niladhari levels for response and recovery efforts, and for managing and disseminating critical information.

The plans at different levels will reflect the inputs of the Incident Command System (ICS) that will be incorporated into emergency operations. The services of the trained teams and personnel will be obtained in emergency situations.
