## Obtain Grants Without Conditions for Lands with Conditional Grants

This guide explains the process for obtaining unconditional grants for lands that were previously issued with conditional grants, under the Land Redemption Ordinance.

This service is for:
- Allottees who possess lands on permits or grants with conditions
- Successors or allies of the original residents who no longer occupy the land

## Important Information

- You must pay the assessed amount to obtain the unconditional grant.
- The assessed amount is the cost incurred by the state to acquire the land, plus 4% interest from the time the land was first granted, minus any lease or interest payments already made.
- There is also a service charge for processing the application.

## What You Need

To apply, you will need to provide:
- Birth certificate or affidavit to prove your relationship to the original allottee
- The original diagram or plan of the land

## Application Process

1. Submit an application indicating your willingness to pay the assessed amount.
2. The Divisional Secretary will verify the payable amount and send a recommendation in Form LR1.
3. Pay the assessed amount, which will be credited to the relevant government account.
4. Complete Form General 118 and submit a survey requisition so the grant can be issued.
5. The Superintendent of Surveys will send the land diagram to the Land Commissioner General to prepare the unconditional grant.
