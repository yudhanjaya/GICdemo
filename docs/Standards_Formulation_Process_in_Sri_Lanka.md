## Standards Formulation in Sri Lanka

The Scientific Standardization Division of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) is responsible for developing national standards for products and services in the industrial and trade sectors. This division consists of three sections: Agriculture and Food, Chemical and Cosmetic, and Textile and Garments, allowing for a multidisciplinary approach to standards development.

The national standards formulated by the SLSI are developed through a committee process and a consultative process, involving the voluntary participation and cooperative effort of all interested parties, including manufacturers, consumers/users, academia, research organizations, public institutions, and independent technical organizations.

The SLSI appoints technical committees called Sectoral Committees to advise and guide the standards formulation activities. These committees are managed by professionally qualified staff of the SLSI, who provide secretarial and technical assistance on matters pertaining to the principles and procedures of standardization.

The standards developed by the SLSI may take various forms, such as:

1. Specifications for materials or products
2. Codes of practice or guides providing recommended practices in a specific field of industry
3. Methods of test
4. Glossaries of terms

Whenever feasible, the SLSI adopts and refers to international standards, such as ISO and ASTM, to align the national standards with international requirements.

In the selection of standards formulation projects, priority is given to standards that facilitate internal and external trade and enhance the international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products, with the prime objective of safeguarding the interests of consumers and the industry.

The SLSI has been awarded the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System Certification by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), which is an indication of the rigorous quality of the standards formulation process.
