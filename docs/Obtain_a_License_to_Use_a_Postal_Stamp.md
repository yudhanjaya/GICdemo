## Obtain a License to Use a Postal Stamp

- The Postmaster General must approve your application, which typically takes around 3 days.
- You will need to provide information required by the Postmaster General, such as details about your mailing operations.
- The postal stamp machine will be supplied by an authorized agent company. You will need to obtain the rules for sale, usage, and the Postmaster General's account number to use when making payments.

To apply for the license, you will need to:
- Create your own application form. There is no standard form provided.
