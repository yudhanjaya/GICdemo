## Conducting Market Investigations and Raids

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) carries out investigations into consumer complaints or reports of unfair trade practices. This guide explains how the CAA investigates markets, takes legal action against traders, and publishes the names of convicted traders.

Any individual consumer or consumer organization can make a complaint or provide information to the CAA about suspected unfair or deceptive trade practices. To make a complaint, you'll need to submit:

- A copy of your purchase receipt
- Details of the defective product
- Any other supporting documents

There is no specific complaint form - you can submit your complaint in a letter addressed to the Director General of the CAA.

### The Investigation Process

1. You submit your complaint to the CAA.
2. The Consumer Affairs & Investigation Division examines the complaint to verify the details.
3. The division designs an investigation plan and assigns it to the Investigation team.
4. The Investigation team conducts the market investigation or raid.
5. The investigation findings and evidence are handed over to the Compliance & Enforcement Division.
6. The Compliance & Enforcement Division drafts the legal documents to file the case in the Magistrate's Court.
7. If the trader is found guilty, the Magistrate can fine them under the provisions of the CAA Act.
