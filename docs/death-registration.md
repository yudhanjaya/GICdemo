# How to Register a Death in Sri Lanka

## What is a Death Certificate?
A death certificate is an official document that proves someone has died. You need it to:
- Close bank accounts

## Important Deadlines
- First 3 days: Free registration
- Within 3 months: Standard registration
- After 3 months: Special process required (see "Late Registration")
