## Extend the Validity of Your Driving License in Sri Lanka

This guide explains the process for extending the validity of your driving license in Sri Lanka. Whether you need to renew your license or add additional vehicle classes, we'll walk you through the steps.

## Important Information

- You must apply within 6 months of your license expiring.
- The cost is Rs. 520 for 1 vehicle class or Rs. 1,020 for 2 vehicle classes under the normal service.
- You can get a priority service for Rs. 770 (1 class) or Rs. 1,720 (2 classes), which will be processed within 1 week.
- If you fail the written or practical exam, you can re-apply up to 3 times by paying an additional fee.

## What You Need

To extend your driving license, you'll need to provide:

1. **National Identity Card (NIC)**: Bring the original and a photocopy.
2. **Current Driving License**: Your existing license.
3. **Medical Certificate**: From an MBBS-certified medical officer.

If applying for a bus or lorry license, you'll also need:
- Medical certificate from the CTB Medical Institute
- Competency certificate from a Grade A driving school
- 3 passport-size photos

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Obtain the "M.T.A. 34" application form from the Werahara office or your local District Secretariat office.
2. Submit the completed application form and required documents to either:
   - The Motor Traffic branch in your District Secretariat office (for normal service)
   - The Werahara office (for priority service)
3. Sit for the written exam when called by the Department of Motor Traffic.
4. If you pass the written exam, you'll be issued a learner's permit.
5. After 3 months, you can take the practical driving test.
6. Hand over your current license to the examiner.
7. The Department will issue your new extended license, which will be sent to you by post. You'll be given a temporary license in the meantime.
