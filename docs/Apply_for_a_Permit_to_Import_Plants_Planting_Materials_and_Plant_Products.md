## Apply for a Permit to Import Plants, Planting Materials, and Plant Products

If you need to import plants, planting materials, or plant products into Sri Lanka, you must obtain an import permit from the National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS). This is required by law to prevent the introduction of plant pests and diseases.

## Important Information

- There is a fee to obtain the import permit application form.
- The time to process a complete application for regularly imported items from regular countries is about 1 week.
- For new plant commodities or imports from new countries, the processing time may vary depending on the pest risk assessment process and approvals from other institutes.
- The NPQS office is open from 8:30 AM to 4:15 PM on weekdays, excluding public holidays.

## What You Need

Depending on what you are importing, you may need to provide the following documents:

- Seed Handler Certificate from the Seed Certification Service
- Application forwarded through the relevant Research Institute of the Department of Agriculture
- Catalogue details (description of new variety)
- Variety Evaluation Report issued by a Research Institute
- Letter from the Department of Animal Production and Health (for animal feed)
- Letter from the Kovil and the Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs (for animal feed)
- Consent letter from the Forest Department (for forest plant seeds)
- No Objection Certificate from the Department of Export Agriculture (for export agricultural crops)
- Approval from the Director General of Agriculture (for bean seed, onion seed, groundnut seed, and maize for popcorn production)

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Collect the application form from the NPQS office or download it from the NPQS website.
2. Complete the application form and gather all the required documents.
