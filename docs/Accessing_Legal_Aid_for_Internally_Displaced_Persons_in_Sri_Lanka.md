## Accessing Legal Aid for Internally Displaced Persons in Sri Lanka

The Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka provides free legal assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) to help them access their rights and entitlements. This service is available to any Sri Lankan citizen who has been displaced from their home due to natural disasters, civil conflicts, or other emergencies.

The Legal Aid Desk for IDPs is managed by Consultant Mr. Suntharalingum, who works to:
- Visit IDP camps and discuss the daily challenges faced by residents
- Coordinate with relevant authorities to address the needs of IDPs
- Report to the government and relief agencies to facilitate the return of IDPs to their home areas
- Ensure IDPs are aware of the Deng Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement
- Help IDPs obtain important legal documents like birth certificates and national ID cards

## What You Need

To access legal aid services, IDPs will need to provide the following:
- National Identity Card (NIC) or other valid ID
- Proof of displacement (e.g., documentation from relief agencies, local authorities)
- Details of the legal issue or assistance required

If you do not have any of these documents, the Legal Aid Desk staff can still assist you in obtaining them.

## How to Get Legal Aid

1. Visit the nearest Divisional Secretariat office and inform them that you require legal assistance as an IDP.
2. The Divisional Secretariat will refer you to the Legal Aid Desk, where you can meet with Consultant Mr. Suntharalingum.
3. Explain your situation and the type of legal aid you need. The consultant will assess your case and provide advice or coordinate further assistance.
4. If required, the consultant will help you prepare any necessary documentation and guide you through the legal process.

The Legal Aid Desk operates during regular government office hours (8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday to Friday) and no appointment is necessary.
