## Obtain Recommendations for Importing Animal Feed and Materials

If you need to import raw materials for animal feed or manufacture animal feed in Sri Lanka, you must obtain the necessary licenses and approvals from the Department of Animal Production and Health.

This process ensures the safety and quality of animal feed products in the country. Whether you are a new importer or already have a license for animal feed manufacturing, you will need to follow these steps.

## Important Information

- Licenses are required under the Animal Feed Act No. 15 of 1986 and 2016.
- If you already have a license for animal feed manufacturing, you do not need a separate license for importing raw materials.
- There is a one-time application fee of LKR 1,000 for registering as an importer.
- There is no fee for obtaining pre-clearance approvals for each import consignment.

To register as an importer and obtain pre-clearance approvals, you will need to provide the following:

- Completed application form for importer registration
- Proforma invoice for each import consignment
- Covering letter with your approved animal feed number

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Register as an importer by submitting the application form and paying the LKR 1,000 fee.
2. For each import consignment, submit the proforma invoice and covering letter to the Registrar (Animal Feed) at the Department of Animal Production and Health.
3. The department will review your documents and provide the necessary pre-clearance approval within 3 working days.
