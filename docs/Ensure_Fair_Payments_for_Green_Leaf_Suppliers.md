The Sri Lanka Tea Board ensures that green leaf suppliers are paid a fair and reasonable price for their produce. If a factory or leaf dealer fails to make timely payments, the Tea Board will intervene to help the supplier recover any outstanding amounts.

All green leaf suppliers are entitled to receive payment by the 20th of the following month. If payments are delayed, suppliers can submit a written request along with a copy of their leaf book to the relevant Assistant Tea Commissioner's office. The Tea Board will then contact the factory or dealer to ensure the outstanding amount is paid.

Failure to make payments can result in the factory's registration or the dealer's permit being canceled by the Tea Board.
