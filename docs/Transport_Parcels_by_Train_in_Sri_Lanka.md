## Transport Parcels by Train in Sri Lanka

You can transport parcels weighing up to 50 kg each by train in Sri Lanka, except for goods prohibited by the Railway Ordinance or other departmental circulars. All railway stations accept parcels for transportation on weekdays from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.

## Important Information

- Parcels must be properly packed to avoid damage.
- You may need to show the contents of the parcel if the station master requests it.
- Attach the recipient's name, address, and national ID number to the parcel.
- The station master can reject any parcel if they are suspicious about the goods or the person transporting them.

## What You Need

- Transport permits for timber or purchase bills for furniture
- Document certifying the value of high-value goods (e.g., purchase bill)
- Revenue license for items like bicycles

## Step-by-Step Process
