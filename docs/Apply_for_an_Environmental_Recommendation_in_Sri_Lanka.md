## Apply for an Environmental Recommendation in Sri Lanka

An Environmental Recommendation (ER) is a document issued by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) for any prescribed activity or industry that is not subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is a legal requirement under the National Environmental Act.

The ER provides guidance and conditions to help mitigate potential environmental pollution from the prescribed activity or industry. If you are planning to start a new business or activity that may have an environmental impact, you will need to obtain an ER from the CEA before proceeding.

## Important Information

- The ER application process is free of charge.
- The processing time for an ER is approximately 1 month, provided all required information and fees are submitted on time.
- The ER is issued to the Municipal Commissioner or Chairman of the relevant Local Authority, with a copy sent to the applicant.

## What You Need

To apply for an ER, you will need to provide the following:

- Completed application form
- Survey plan of the site
- Building plan (if applicable)
- Route sketch showing the location of the proposed site from the nearest town

## Application Process

1. Obtain the ER application form from the CEA Head Office or any CEA Provincial/District Office, or download it from the CEA website (www.cea.lk).
2. Submit the duly filled application form to the CEA.
3. If the application is complete and all required documents are provided, the CEA will request the applicant to pay the inspection fee.
4. After the inspection fee is paid, the CEA will conduct a site inspection.
