The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) is responsible for preparing and publishing various types of geological maps for Sri Lanka. These maps provide detailed information about the country's surface geology and structural features.

The GSMB has published 21 geological maps at a scale of 1:100,000, covering the entire land area of Sri Lanka. These maps are available for purchase in both hard copy and digital (DGN) formats. Additionally, the GSMB has published quarter geological maps at a scale of 1:250,000, which are also available for purchase in hard copy and digital (SHP) formats.

The GSMB is currently working on preparing 1:50,000 scale Quaternary maps for the coastal areas of Sri Lanka. So far, 3 such maps (Kalutara, Balapitiya-Ambalangoda, and Matara) have been published and are available for purchase in hard copy and digital (DGN and SHP) formats.

The GSMB is also engaged in the preparation of 1:100,000 scale geochemical maps for Sri Lanka.
