## Register a Death Occurred at Home

This guide explains the process to register a death that occurred at home in Sri Lanka. Registering a death is an important legal requirement that helps the government maintain accurate records and allows the deceased's family to access benefits and services.

## Important Information

- You must inform the Grama Niladhari (village officer) within 7 days of the death.
- Death registration is free of charge if done within 3 months of the death. After 3 months, there is a late registration fee.
- The death certificate is issued to the informant free of charge.

## What You Need

To register the death, you will need:
- National Identity Card (NIC) of the deceased
- NIC of the informant (the person providing the death details)
- Any other documents related to the deceased, such as a birth certificate

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Inform the Grama Niladhari (village officer) within 7 days of the death occurring.
2. The Grama Niladhari will send a report to the Registrar of Births and Deaths in the area where the death occurred.
3. The Registrar will register the death and issue a death certificate to the informant.
