## Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Services in Sri Lanka

The Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Board provides accredited secondary standards dosimetry calibration services essential for the implementation of radiation protection programs in Sri Lanka. These services ensure the radiation safety of workers, the public, and the environment.

The laboratory uses the latest operational quantities recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) to calibrate dose rate meters, electronic personal dosimeters, and contamination monitors. A 30x30x15 cm³ PMMA phantom is used to represent the human torso and account for backscattering during the calibration of individual monitoring instruments. Area monitoring instruments and dosimeters are calibrated in free air.

Calibration factors are provided for reference conditions (ambient temperature 20°C, atmospheric pressure 101.325 kPa) where applicable.
