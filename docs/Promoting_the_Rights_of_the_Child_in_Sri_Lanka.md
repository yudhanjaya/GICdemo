## Promoting the Rights of the Child in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka has ratified the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. The Department of Probation and Child Care Services is responsible for implementing the articles of this convention to ensure the welfare of children in Sri Lanka. The department has been implementing several programs to promote the rights of the child.
