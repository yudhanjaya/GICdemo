# Tea Certification in Sri Lanka

The Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) and the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) operate a Product Certification Scheme to certify the manufacturing process and final product of black tea in Sri Lanka. This voluntary certification scheme provides an internationally recognized third-party guarantee of quality to customers.

The certification is based on the applicable standards, regulations, and industry codes of practice. It includes an assessment of the manufacturer's quality management system and testing of tea samples.

## Who Can Apply?
Any tea manufacturer in Sri Lanka who is interested in obtaining the Product Certification Scheme for Tea (PCST) can apply.

## What You Need to Apply
To apply for tea certification, you will need to:

1. Obtain the application form from SLSI by paying a fee of LKR 2,000.
2. Submit the completed application form along with your company's quality manual detailing the policies and procedures as per the relevant standards.
3. Pay the application processing fee as specified in the fee structure.

The application fee and processing fee are non-refundable.

## Application Process
1. SLSI will appoint an auditor to evaluate your company's quality manual for adequacy against the applicable standards and requirements.
2. Once your manual is found adequate, SLSI will schedule an on-site assessment of your manufacturing facility.
3. During the on-site audit, the audit team will review your operations and processes, and collect tea samples for testing.
4. If any non-conformities are identified, you will need to propose and implement corrective actions. SLSI will verify the effectiveness of the actions through a follow-up audit.
5. Upon successful completion of the audit and testing, your application will be submitted to the Sri Lanka Tea Product Certification Committee (SLTPCC) for approval.
6. If approved, you will be issued a certificate that is valid for 3 years, subject to periodic surveillance audits.

## Fees
The fees for the certification process are determined by the SLTPCC and are subject to revision. The current fee structure is available for download.
