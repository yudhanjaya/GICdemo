## Establishing a Medical Center in Residential Homes

Residents of adult or children's homes may be able to establish a medical center within their facilities. To do so, you will need to submit a written request to the Commissioner of Ayurveda.

## Important Information

- The medical center must be approved by the Commissioner of Ayurveda.
- There is no cost to submit the request, but establishing the medical center may have associated expenses.
- The medical center can only be established in residential homes that have a sufficient number of residents.

## What You Need

To submit the request, you will need:
- A letter on the organization's letterhead or with an official rubber stamp
- Details about the residential home, including the number of residents

## How to Apply

2. Include information about the home, such as the number of residents and the need for a medical facility.
