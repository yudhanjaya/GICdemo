The Construction Guarantee Fund (CGF) is a government-funded organization that provides bonds and guarantees to construction contractors in Sri Lanka. This service helps contractors, especially small and medium-scale ones, meet the requirements for bidding on and executing construction contracts in both the public and private sectors.

Prior to the establishment of the CGF in 1999, construction contractors faced difficulties obtaining bonds and guarantees from commercial banks, which often demanded large cash margins or immovable property as collateral. The CGF was set up to address this issue and provide contractors with more reasonable conditions.

To obtain bonds and guarantees from the CGF, construction contractors must be registered with the Institute for Construction Training and Development (ICTAD) and provide the necessary documentation to the CGF. The CGF offers the following types of bonds and guarantees:

1. Bid Bonds
2. Performance Bonds/Advance Payment Guarantees
3. Maintenance/Retention/Combined Bonds

Contractors interested in the CGF's services must first register with the fund by submitting the "Contractor Information (COIN)" form. They can then apply for the specific bonds or guarantees they need using the corresponding application forms.

The CGF is administered by a Board of Trustees representing the government and private sectors, under the chairmanship of the Secretary to the Ministry in charge of the construction industry. The fund's main office is located at "Savsiripaya", No. 123, Wijerama Mawatha, and is open from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Monday to Friday.

For more information or assistance, contractors can contact the CGF by phone at +94 11 267 3087 or +94 11 267 3088, or by email at info@cgf.gov.lk. They can also visit any Divisional Secretariat office for in-person support.
