## Apply for a Procession Permit in Sri Lanka

If you need to organize a public procession or demonstration in Sri Lanka, you must obtain a permit from the local police. This guide explains the process for applying for a procession permit.

A procession permit allows you to legally hold a public march, parade, or gathering. The police will review your application to ensure the procession can be conducted safely and without disrupting the community.

## Important Information

- You must apply for the permit at least 6 hours before the planned procession.
- There is no cost to apply for a procession permit.
- The Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in your area is responsible for approving or denying the permit.

## What You Need to Apply

To apply for a procession permit, you'll need to provide the following:

- A handwritten application form
- Details of your residential and office addresses
- Details of your place of employment
- If you're part of a political party, the name of the party
- Copies of any posters, flyers, or other materials to be used in the procession

## How to Apply

1. Visit the police station responsible for the area where the procession will take place.
2. Submit your handwritten application form and supporting documents to the Officer in Charge (OIC).
3. The OIC will review your application and, if satisfied, pass it on to the ASP for approval.
4. The ASP will recheck the details and either approve or deny the permit.

The entire process typically takes 2-3 hours. The ASP's office is open from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday to Friday.
