Registered trade unions in Sri Lanka must notify the Registrar of Trade Unions about any changes to their elected officers. This guide explains the process for submitting the required documentation.

## Important Information

- You must submit the change of officers within 7 days of the election or appointment.
- There is no fee to submit the change of officers.

- The attendance sign-in sheet to prove that a meeting with the quorum was held constitutionally
- A copy of the meeting minutes certified by the secretary
- A completed Form L
