# How to Register a Marriage in Sri Lanka

## Understanding Marriage Registration
A marriage certificate is an official document that proves you are legally married. You'll need it for:
- Adding your spouse to insurance policies
- Applying for joint bank accounts
- Immigration purposes
- Property registration
- Getting your spouse's pension benefits
- Proving your marital status for any legal purpose

## Types of Marriage Registration

### 1. General Marriage Registration
For all religions except Muslims. This is the most common type of marriage registration in Sri Lanka.

#### Who can use this?
You can use general marriage registration if:
- You're 18 or older
- You're not closely related to each other (the office can explain prohibited relationships)
- Neither person is currently married
- At least one person isn't Muslim

#### Residence Requirements
You must prove where you live. This means:
- Both of you must have lived in your local area for at least 10 days before applying, OR
- If one person lives outside Sri Lanka:
  - The person in Sri Lanka must have lived there for 10 days
  - Bring proof of the other person's foreign residence
- If both live outside Sri Lanka:
  - One must stay in Sri Lanka for at least 4 days
  - Bring proof of both people's foreign residence

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. Get Marriage Notice Forms
