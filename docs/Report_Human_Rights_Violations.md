## Report Human Rights Violations

The Human Rights Bureau was established in 2005 under the Legal Aid Commission to promote fundamental rights litigation. The Bureau's responsibilities have expanded with the introduction of the ICCPR Act, and it now handles a range of human rights-related activities:

- Providing human rights counseling
- Conducting awareness programs for police officers
- Publishing materials on human rights
- Organizing legal aid clinics
- Coordinating with institutions involved in human rights activities

The Bureau plays a crucial role as the Supreme Court recognizes the Legal Aid Commission as an institution to refer allegations of fundamental rights violations received by the Supreme Court Registry. Once a reference is made, the Commission is responsible for taking necessary steps to proceed with the case. The Commission has also entered into an MOU with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka to promote human rights litigation.

## Important Information

- The Human Rights Bureau is staffed by one permanent legal officer, Uma Wijesinghe.
- Contact the Bureau at +94 11 243 3618 ext 808 or humanrights@legalaid.gov.lk.
