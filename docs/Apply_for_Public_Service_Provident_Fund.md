The Public Service Provident Fund (PSPF) is a retirement savings scheme for government employees in Sri Lanka. It allows you to contribute a portion of your monthly salary towards your future pension and benefits.

As a government employee, you are automatically enrolled in the PSPF. Your employer will deduct a percentage of your salary each month and contribute it to your PSPF account. You can also make additional voluntary contributions to grow your retirement savings.

The PSPF provides financial security for you and your family upon retirement, disability, or death. It offers a lump-sum payment or monthly pension, depending on your years of service and contribution amount.

## Important Information

- Contributions: 10% of your monthly salary is deducted and contributed to your PSPF account. Your employer also contributes an additional 15% of your salary.
- Withdrawal: You can withdraw your full PSPF balance upon retirement (age 60) or earlier in case of permanent disability. Partial withdrawals are allowed for specific purposes like housing, education, or medical emergencies.
- Beneficiaries: You can nominate your spouse, children, or other dependents as beneficiaries to receive your PSPF benefits in case of your death.

## What You Need

To apply for the PSPF, you will need the following:

- National Identity Card (NIC)
- Appointment letter or confirmation of employment from your government department
- Bank account details for your monthly pension payments (if applicable)

## Application Process

1. Your employment with the government department will automatically enroll you in the PSPF.
2. Your employer will deduct the 10% contribution from your monthly salary and remit it to the PSPF.
3. You can check your PSPF account balance and transaction history on the Department of Pensions website.
4. Upon retirement or in case of permanent disability, you can apply to withdraw your PSPF balance.
5. In the event of your death, your nominated beneficiaries can apply to receive the PSPF benefits.
