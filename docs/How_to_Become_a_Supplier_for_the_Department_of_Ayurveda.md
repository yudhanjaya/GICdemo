## How to Become a Supplier for the Department of Ayurveda

If you want to become a supplier for the Department of Ayurveda, there are a few steps you need to follow:

1. **Register with the Central Bank as a Government Supplier**: All the required details for this registration process are published in national newspapers at the beginning of each year.

2. **Register with the Department of Ayurveda**: If you supply dried, raw, or finished Ayurvedic drugs, you need to register with the Department of Ayurveda. The required details for this registration are also published in national newspapers at the beginning of each year.

It's important to note that some government or semi-government institutions may be able to engage in supplying without being registered, such as the State Printing Corporation for printing services.

## Important Information

- Registration with the Central Bank or the Department of Ayurveda is not required for all suppliers. The requirements depend on the type of goods or services you are providing.
- The registration process and details are published in national newspapers at the beginning of each year, so be sure to check for the latest information.
