The Research Cell of the Ministry of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations aims to promote and facilitate research related to technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Sri Lanka. This guide outlines the key objectives and activities of the Research Cell.

## Objective 1: Foster TVET Research
The Research Cell will work to increase the quantity and quality of research conducted on TVET-related issues in Sri Lanka. Currently, there is a lack of research focus on the TVET sector compared to the education and higher education sectors. The Research Cell will aim to inculcate a research culture within the TVET institutions and encourage officers to engage in TVET research at both the institutional and national levels.

## Objective 2: Facilitate TVET Research
The Research Cell will act as a key partner in facilitating TVET research by disseminating information and research findings among interested parties, especially TVET researchers. This will involve introducing mechanisms to effectively share TVET research information within the sector.

## Objective 3: Build Research Partnerships
The Research Cell will work to create beneficial linkages with local and international research organizations to enhance the quality of TVET research in Sri Lanka. This includes collaborating with institutions such as the Centre for Policy Research, National Science Foundation, the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER) in Australia, and the PCTRT of RMIT University.

By focusing on these three key objectives, the Research Cell aims to foster a vibrant TVET research ecosystem in Sri Lanka, leading to evidence-based policy and planning for the development of the TVET sector.
