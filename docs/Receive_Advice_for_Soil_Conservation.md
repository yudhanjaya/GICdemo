## Receive Advice for Soil Conservation

If you need guidance on soil conservation practices for your land, the National Resources Management Centre (NRMC) can provide expert advice. This service is available to any person in Sri Lanka who wants to learn how to better manage and protect their soil.

The NRMC can advise you on techniques like contour planting, cover cropping, and erosion control. Their experts can visit your property, assess the condition of your soil, and recommend specific actions you can take to improve soil health and prevent degradation.

To receive this advice, you can submit a request in writing to the Additional Director at the NRMC office in Peradeniya. There is no application form or fee required. Simply provide details about your land and the issues you would like assistance with.

The NRMC will review your request and send an expert to your location, usually within 2-3 weeks. The site visit and advice are provided free of charge. After the assessment, you will receive a report outlining the NRMC's recommendations.
