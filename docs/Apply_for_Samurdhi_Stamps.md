## Apply for Samurdhi Stamps

The Samurdhi program provides financial assistance and other benefits to low-income families in Sri Lanka. As part of this program, eligible families can obtain Samurdhi stamps at subsidized rates to purchase essential goods and services.

Samurdhi stamps are available at the following rates:

- Rs. 210/- (for empowered families)
- Rs. 250/- (for single-member families living alone)
- Rs. 375/- (for single-member families living alone, 50% increase from Mahinda Chinthanaya)
- Rs. 350/- (for two-member families)
- Rs. 615/- (for families with 3-5 members)
- Rs. 1,500/- (for families with more than 6 members)

The stamps can be used to purchase goods from Samurdhi cooperative stores or to withdraw cash from Samurdhi banks. A portion of the stamp value also goes towards social security funds and the Samurdhi housing lottery.

## Eligibility

Families living below the poverty line, as determined by the Department of Statistics, are eligible to receive Samurdhi stamps. The poverty line is currently set at 15.2% of the population.

## How to Apply

To apply for Samurdhi stamps, you need to make a request to the Samurdhi Development Officer at your local Divisional Secretariat office. There is no formal application form - you can simply visit the office and make the request.
