The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) conducts core drilling investigations for various engineering geology projects, including geotechnical investigations for dams, tunnels, canals, buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. GSMB also performs core drilling to study the subsurface configuration of mineral occurrences.

GSMB has the necessary drilling machines to perform investigations up to 300 meters below the surface. They also have hand and power auguring machines to conduct mineral and other related investigations within the overburden cover.

To request GSMB's core drilling services, you can submit an application to the Deputy Director (Geology) or the Assistant Director (Geology) at the GSMB head office. The application process and timeline will depend on the specific requirements of your project.
