## Establish a Consumer Organization in Sri Lanka

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) is responsible for promoting consumer education, empowering consumers, and encouraging the establishment of consumer organizations in Sri Lanka. This guide explains how individuals or groups can request the CAA to help set up a new consumer organization.

The CAA offers various programs to raise awareness about consumer rights and responsibilities, and to support the formation of consumer groups. These include:

- Awareness programs for target audiences like government officers, students, and community organizations
- Inter-school competitions on topics like art, essays, quizzes, and drama
