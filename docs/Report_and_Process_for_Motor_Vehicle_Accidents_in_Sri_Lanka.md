## Report and Process for Motor Vehicle Accidents in Sri Lanka

If you are involved in a motor vehicle accident in Sri Lanka, you must report it to the police immediately. This guide explains the step-by-step process to follow.

The first thing to do is inform the police about the accident, either by calling them or visiting the nearest police station. A police officer will then come to the accident location.

The police officer will:
- Take the driver's license from the driver(s) involved
- Document the accident by taking notes, sketching the scene, and marking where it occurred
- Try to resolve any issues between the parties involved

The police officer will then:
- Call all parties to the police station
- Provide a complaint statement and a B form (1/B) if there is any vehicle damage
- Determine who was at fault based on the "give way to right" law

If there are any injuries or fatalities, the police will take action to get medical attention and transport the bodies to the hospital.

The police officer will file a court case against the person found to be at fault. That person must appear in court as soon as possible. If they do not appear, further action will be taken against them.

The person not found at fault will have their driver's license returned by the police.
