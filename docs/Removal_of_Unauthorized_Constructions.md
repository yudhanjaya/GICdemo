## Removal of Unauthorized Constructions

This guide explains the process for reporting and removing unauthorized constructions in Sri Lanka. As a citizen, you can notify the authorities about any illegal building or structure in your area, and the Urban Development Authority (UDA) will investigate and take necessary action.

## Important Information

- There is no specific application form required. You can submit a letter or complaint to notify the authorities.
- Complaints can be submitted on any weekday between 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
- The cost for this service cannot be determined in advance, as it depends on the specific case.
- The process can take between 2 weeks to 3 months, depending on the complexity of the case.

## What You Need to Provide

When submitting a complaint, please include the following:
1. Photographs of the unauthorized construction
2. A sketch or map showing the location of the construction

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Write a letter or submit a complaint to the Enforcement Division of the Urban Development Authority, providing the necessary information and documents.
2. The UDA will investigate the complaint and determine if the construction is unauthorized.
3. If the construction is found to be illegal, the UDA will take appropriate enforcement action, which may include issuing a demolition order.
4. The UDA will coordinate with the relevant authorities to ensure the unauthorized construction is removed.
