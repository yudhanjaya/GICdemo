### 2. Title

File a Complaint with the Crime Branch

### 3. First Paragraph

If you need to report a crime or file a complaint, you can do so by visiting the Crime Branch (CB) of your local police station. The CB investigates serious crimes such as rape, child abuse, and other major offenses. This guide explains the process for filing a complaint with the CB.

### 4. Important Information

There are no application forms required to file a complaint with the CB. However, you will need to provide detailed information about the incident and any evidence you have. The CB will issue you a receipt (B form) for your complaint.

There is a fee of LKR 25 per page for any copies of the complaint extracted from the police station records. The police do not impose fines for false statements, but making a false complaint can result in the complainant being submitted to court and fined by the judge.

### 5. What People Need

To file a complaint with the CB, you will need to bring:
- Any evidence related to the incident, such as documents, photos, or recordings
- Your National Identity Card or other valid ID

### 6. Step-by-Step Process

1. Visit the crime investigation division of your local police station and inform the officer about your complaint.
2. Provide the officer with details about the incident and any evidence you have.
3. The officer will write down your complaint in the complaint book and issue you a receipt (B form).
4. The CB will collect evidence related to the case.
5. If there is sufficient evidence, the CB will take the suspect(s) into custody.
6. The suspect(s) will then be handed over to the court by the CB.

If another division of the police forwards a case to the CB, the process is as follows:
1. The other division sends the case to the CB if it is relevant to their jurisdiction.
2. The CB collects evidence about the case.
3. If there is sufficient evidence, the CB takes the suspect(s) into custody.
4. The suspect(s) are then handed over to the court.

The CB only handles cases that fall under the 21 crimes listed in their jurisdiction. The victim must also have evidence to support the complaint.
