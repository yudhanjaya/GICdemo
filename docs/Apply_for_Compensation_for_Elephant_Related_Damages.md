## Apply for Compensation for Elephant-Related Damages

This guide explains how to apply for compensation if you have suffered human deaths, injuries, or property loss due to encounters with wild elephants in Sri Lanka. The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) provides this compensation to help affected citizens.

If you or your family have been impacted by an elephant-related incident, you may be eligible for compensation. This includes cases of human death or injury, as well as damage to your home or other property.

## Important Information

- Compensation is provided free of charge.
- You must apply within 42 days of the incident.
- Payments are made directly to the affected individual or their family.

## What You Need

To apply for compensation, you will need the following documents:

- Evidence of the incident, issued by the Grama Niladhari (GN) and certified by the Assistant Government Agent (AGA) or Government Agent (GA).
- Proof of identity, such as a National Identity Card.
- Proof of relationship to the deceased, if applying on behalf of a family member.

## How to Apply

1. Visit your local Grama Niladhari (GN) office.
2. Provide the GN with details of the incident and request an official evidence document.
3. The GN will issue an evidence document, which you must then have certified by the AGA or GA.
4. Complete the application form, available from the GN office or the DWC website.
5. Submit the completed application, along with the required documents, to the DWC office.

The application process takes 10-15 working days. The DWC's Deputy Director or Assistant Director of Elephant Conservation, along with the Rural Sociologist, will review your claim and determine the appropriate compensation.
