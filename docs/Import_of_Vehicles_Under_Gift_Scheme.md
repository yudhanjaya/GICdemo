## Import of Vehicles Under Gift Scheme

This guide explains the process for importing a motor vehicle into Sri Lanka under the Gift Scheme. The Gift Scheme allows individuals, temples, and organizations to import a used vehicle as a gift from a close family member, temple, or organization.

To use the Gift Scheme, you must be the recipient of the gifted vehicle, and the vehicle must have been used before. The vehicle must also be right-hand drive and cannot have a CFC air conditioning system. Additionally, the vehicle must have been shipped after all earth and mud have been removed.

## Important Information

- The Gift Scheme is currently suspended. No new applications are being accepted.
- If you previously imported a vehicle under the Gift Scheme, you cannot import another vehicle under this scheme.
- There are specific requirements and documents needed for importing vehicles under the Gift Scheme for family members, temples, and organizations.
- Fees for importing vehicles under the Gift Scheme range from 15% to 150% of the CIF value, depending on the age of the vehicle.
