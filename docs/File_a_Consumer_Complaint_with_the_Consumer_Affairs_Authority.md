## File a Consumer Complaint with the Consumer Affairs Authority

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) helps consumers resolve issues with goods or services they have purchased. If you have a complaint about a product or service, you can file it with the CAA, and they will investigate and try to reach a resolution.

## Who Can File a Complaint?

Any consumer who has purchased a good or service can file a complaint with the CAA.

## What to Know Before Filing a Complaint

- You must file your complaint within 3 months of purchasing a product or 1 month of receiving a service.
