## Importing Vehicles Under the Gift Scheme for Organizations

This guide explains the process for importing vehicles under the Gift Scheme for organizations in Sri Lanka. The Gift Scheme allows non-nationals residing in Sri Lanka to import a vehicle for their personal or family use, using foreign earnings.

To qualify, you must:
- Be a non-national resident of Sri Lanka
- Use foreign earnings to purchase the vehicle
- Ensure the vehicle is right-hand drive and for your exclusive use or your family's use
- Not lease, mortgage, or take the vehicle out of Sri Lanka when you leave the country

## Important Information

- The vehicle must be registered in your name within 2 weeks of clearance.
- You cannot purchase the vehicle using your own funds.
- You must provide all required supporting documents.
- The vehicle must be used solely within your organization.
- There is a license fee of 0.1% of the CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) value.
- If the import value exceeds the invoice value, you must pay the difference.

## What You Need

To apply, you'll need to provide:
- A copy of your passport
- Documents to prove your date of arrival, period of stay, and reasons for staying in Sri Lanka
- Your visa details
- Vehicle registration documents
- Documents to identify you as the licensee
- Your latest bank statements and documents to prove the source of your funds
- If you own a vehicle abroad, the particulars and a copy of the original registration

## Application Process

1. Obtain the application form from Unit 2.
2. Submit the completed application form and supporting documents to Unit 2.
3. If all documents are in order, you'll be directed to the cashier to pay the license fee.
4. Once the fee is paid, your license will be issued.
