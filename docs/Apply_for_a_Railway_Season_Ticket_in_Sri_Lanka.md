## Apply for a Railway Season Ticket in Sri Lanka

Railway season tickets provide unlimited travel between two stations for a specific time period. There are two types of season tickets available: private and government.

You can apply for a new season ticket or renew an existing one at any railway station in Sri Lanka. The process is the same for both private and government season tickets, though government employees follow a slightly different procedure.

## Important Information

- Season tickets are valid from the 1st to the 7th of each month.
- The cost varies by ticket type and class. Prices start from LKR 200 for a weekly 2nd class ticket.
- You can purchase season tickets at any railway station ticket office.

## What You Need

To apply for a new season ticket, you'll need:
- Completed application form (Form 2.11 or 2.12)
- Two 2" x 2.25" color photographs
- LKR 200 for a new season ticket folder

If renewing an existing ticket, you'll need to bring your current season ticket folder.

## How to Apply

1. Obtain an application form from the station master or download it from the Sri Lanka Railways website.
2. Fill out the form completely and attach the required photographs.
3. Submit the application and payment at the ticket office of your nearest railway station.
4. You'll receive a receipt, which you can use in place of the season ticket folder until it's ready.
5. The station master will process your application and issue the new season ticket folder, usually within 2 minutes.
