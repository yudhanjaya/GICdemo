## Apply for Dual Citizenship in Sri Lanka

The Department of Immigration and Emigration offers dual citizenship for Sri Lankans who have lost their Sri Lankan citizenship or are likely to lose it. This guide explains who is eligible, what documents are required, and how to apply.

## Who is Eligible for Dual Citizenship?

You can apply for dual citizenship if:

1. Your Sri Lankan citizenship has ceased under Sections 19, 20, or 21 of the Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948.
2. You are likely to lose your Sri Lankan citizenship.

There are two types of dual citizenship applications:

1. **Resumption**: If you lost your Sri Lankan citizenship after obtaining citizenship in another country, you can apply to resume your Sri Lankan citizenship.
2. **Retention**: If you want to obtain citizenship in another country while retaining your Sri Lankan citizenship, you can apply for dual citizenship.

## What You Need to Apply

To apply for dual citizenship, you must submit the following documents:

1. Your original birth certificate or a certified copy.
2. If married, your marriage certificate or a certified copy.
3. Additional documents based on your application type:
   - Resumption: Certified copies of your foreign citizenship certificate, foreign passport, and a recent police clearance report.
   - Retention: Certified copies of your current Sri Lankan passport, permanent residence visa of the foreign country, and a recent police clearance report.
4. If applying under specific categories (age, professional, assets/properties, fixed deposit, or Treasury Bonds/Security Investment Account), you must provide the relevant supporting documents.
5. If applying as a spouse or unmarried child under 22, you must provide additional documents such as the marriage certificate, birth certificate, and parents' passports.

All documents in languages other than English, Sinhala, or Tamil must be submitted with an English translation.

## How to Apply

1. Complete the application form in block capitals, deleting any inapplicable words.
2. Attach one passport-size color photograph to the application form.
3. Submit the duly completed application and supporting documents directly to the Department of Immigration and Emigration or to a Sri Lankan overseas mission.
4. If submitting through a Sri Lankan overseas mission, the documents must be authenticated by the head of the mission or a senior officer.
5. The Department of Immigration and Emigration will authenticate the documents when the application is received.

The dual citizenship application fees are as follows:

- Main applicant: USD 2,000
- Spouse of the applicant: USD 500
- Unmarried child below 22 years: USD 500
- Issuance of certified copies of certificates: LKR 2,000
