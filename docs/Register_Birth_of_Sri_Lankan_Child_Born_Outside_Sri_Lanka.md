## Register Birth of Sri Lankan Child Born Outside Sri Lanka

If you are a Sri Lankan citizen living abroad and have a child born outside of Sri Lanka, you must register your child's birth with the Department of Immigration and Emigration within one year of the birth. This ensures your child's Sri Lankan citizenship is confirmed.

Registering your child's birth will provide them with a Birth Registration Certificate, which is an important document for accessing government services and benefits in Sri Lanka.

## Important Information

- You must register your child's birth within 1 year of the birth date.
- Registering after 1 year will result in a fine.
- The registration fee is LKR 5,750 if done within the first year, or LKR 500 per year for late registration.
- You can submit the application at the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo or through the Sri Lankan mission in the country where your child was born.

## What You Need

To register your child's birth, you'll need to provide the following documents:

1. Birth Certificate of the child issued by the country where the birth took place. If the certificate is not in English, you'll need to provide an English translation.
2. Consular Birth Certificate issued by the Registrar General's Department of Sri Lanka.
3. Original Birth Certificates of the parents.
4. If the parent is a Sri Lankan citizen by registration, the relevant certificate.
5. Original Marriage Certificate of the parents.
6. Original Travel Documents and Visas held by the parents to prove residence abroad at the time of the child's birth.

## Application Process

1. Obtain an Application Form from the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo, the Sri Lankan mission in your country of residence, or download it online.
2. Complete the application form and gather all the required supporting documents.
3. If submitting through the Sri Lankan mission, have all documents attested by an authorized officer and ensure they have the officer's signature and stamp.
4. Submit the completed application and documents to the Citizenship Division of the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo or through the Sri Lankan mission.
5. The Citizenship Division will process your application and mail the Birth Registration Certificate to the Sri Lankan mission for you to collect.
