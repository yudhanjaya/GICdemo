## Obtaining Environmental Approval for Development Projects in Sri Lanka

In Sri Lanka, any development project that may have significant environmental impacts must undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process to obtain environmental approval before proceeding. The EIA process helps predict and mitigate the potential impacts of a project on the natural and social environment, ensuring sustainable development.

The EIA process is a legal requirement for prescribed development projects in Sri Lanka, as per the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980 and subsequent gazette notifications. This guide explains the steps involved in obtaining environmental approval through the EIA process.

## Who Needs Environmental Approval?

Any individual, company, or organization planning a development project in Sri Lanka must obtain environmental approval if their project is listed as a "prescribed project" in the Government Gazette No. 772/22 of 24th June 1993 and No. 859/14 of 23rd February 1995. These prescribed projects include activities such as large-scale construction, mining, industrial facilities, and infrastructure development.

## The EIA Process

### 1. Submitting Preliminary Information
As soon as the project concept is developed and the location is decided, the project proponent must submit preliminary information about the proposed project to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). This can be done by filling out a simple form provided by the CEA.

### 2. Determining the Project Approving Agency
Based on the preliminary information, the CEA will designate a "Project Approving Agency" to oversee the EIA process. This could be the CEA itself, the Coast Conservation Department, the Department of Wildlife Conservation, or another relevant government agency.

### 3. Preparing the Terms of Reference (ToR)
The Project Approving Agency will prepare the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the EIA report by conducting one or more "scoping" meetings. The ToR outlines the specific requirements and scope of the EIA study.

### 4. Conducting the EIA Study
The project proponent must hire consultants to prepare the EIA report based on the ToR. The EIA report should be a concise document (around 100 pages) written in easy-to-understand language, covering the following:
- Details of the proposed project
- Description of the existing environment
- Positive and negative impacts of the project
- Proposed mitigation measures
- Reasonable alternatives
- Monitoring program

### 5. Submitting and Reviewing the EIA Report
The project proponent must submit the required number of copies of the EIA report (including Sinhala and Tamil translations) to the Project Approving Agency. The agency will then appoint a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) to independently review the EIA report and provide observations.

### 6. Obtaining the Environmental Clearance
The Project Approving Agency will use the TEC's observations to make a decision on granting environmental clearance for the project. The concurrence of the Central Environmental Authority is also required for the decision to be effective.

## Timelines and Validity

The Project Approving Agency has 116 working days to process the EIA from the day the preliminary information is submitted, provided the information is sufficient. However, there is no time limit for the project proponent to prepare the EIA report, which can take 3 months to 1 year, depending on the project.

The environmental clearance is generally valid for 3 years. If the project proponent does not commence work within this period, they must apply for a renewal of the approval.

## Appeals and Other Permits

If the project proponent disagrees with the decision of the Project Approving Agency, they have the right to appeal to the Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, whose decision is final.

Even after obtaining the environmental clearance, the project proponent must also obtain other necessary permits and approvals from relevant local authorities and government institutions before starting the project.
