## Placement Assistance for Students Who Completed Technical Training

This guide explains the process for students who have completed full-time technical training courses to find employment. The government's Placement for Employment program helps connect these students with job opportunities.

## Important Information

- This service is available to all students who have completed technical training programs at Colleges of Technology or Technical Colleges.
- There is no cost for this placement assistance service.
- Students can access this service through their college's Career Guidance Center.

## What You Need

To use the Placement for Employment program, students will need to provide the following information to their college's Career Guidance Center:

- Full name
- Contact details (phone number and email address)

## How the Placement Process Works

1. The Career Guidance Center at the student's college will gather information on students who have completed their technical training programs.
2. The center will check their database of available job openings and try to match students with suitable positions.
