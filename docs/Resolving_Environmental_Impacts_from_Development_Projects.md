## Resolving Environmental Impacts from Development Projects

This guide explains the process for resolving environmental impacts from development projects in Sri Lanka. If you are planning a new development project, you must obtain a resolution for any potential environmental impacts through the Committee for Environment.

The Committee for Environment, which is part of the Urban Development Authority (UDA), reviews applications and makes recommendations to address environmental concerns. This process helps ensure development projects are completed in an environmentally responsible manner.

## Important Information

- There are fees associated with the environmental impact review process, based on the estimated value of the project and the recommendations from the Central Environmental Authority.
- The basic investigation report takes approximately 3 months to complete, while the full environmental impact assessment report takes around 6 months.

## What You Need

To apply for a resolution on environmental impacts, you will need to provide the following:

1. A project report
2. A copy of the survey plan
3. A copy of the building plan (if available)
4. A sketch showing the access route to the land
5. Recommendations from other relevant institutions

## Application Process

1. Submit your application and supporting documents to the UDA.
2. The Committee for Environment will review your application and conduct an investigation.
3. The committee will make recommendations to address any environmental concerns.
4. You will be notified of the committee's decision and any required actions.
