## Filing a Complaint for Violation of Measurement Laws

If you have information or evidence that someone is violating Sri Lanka's measurement laws, you can file a complaint with the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department. This guide explains how to submit a complaint and what happens next.

## What is a Measurement Law Violation?

You can file a complaint if you have information about someone:

- Making false, incorrect, or untrue declarations about the number, quantity, measure, gauge, or weight of goods in connection with their purchase, sale, weighing, or measurement
- Selling or delivering less than the quantity demanded or represented
- Using weights, measures, or measuring instruments that are not correct for trade purposes

## How to File a Complaint

You can submit a complaint in the following ways:

- Write a letter to the Director of the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department
- Call the department at +94 11 258 8914
- Send a fax to +94 11 259 7758
- Visit the Director or an agent of the department in person

There is no fee to file a complaint, and you do not need to provide any supporting documents. However, providing evidence and information about the violation will help the department investigate.

## What Happens Next?

1. If the complaint is made directly to the department, the Director will forward it to the Assistant Superintendent.
