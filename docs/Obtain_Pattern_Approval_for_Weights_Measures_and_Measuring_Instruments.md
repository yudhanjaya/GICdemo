# Obtain Pattern Approval for Weights, Measures, and Measuring Instruments

The Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department holds the authority to approve weights, measures, and weighing or measuring instruments that are manufactured or imported according to OIML 76 standards. This process is required for anyone who wants to manufacture or sell these types of instruments in Sri Lanka.

To obtain pattern approval, you must meet the following criteria:

- Possess a repair license from the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department
- If the instrument is imported, be an authorized dealer for the manufacturer

If you don't have a repair license, you'll need to apply for one before submitting your pattern approval request.

## What You Need to Apply

To apply for pattern approval, you'll need to submit the following documents:

1. **Business Registration Certificate**
2. **Repair License**
3. Operation Manual, Service Manual, and Circuit Diagram
4. Load cell details
5. Letter of authorized dealership from the foreign manufacturer (for imported instruments)
6. Copies of software
7. Sample test data report (optional)

## How to Apply

1. Write a letter to the Director of the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department requesting pattern approval. In the letter, specify the type of scale, model, and measurement range you want to get approved.
2. Submit the letter and all required documents to the department.
3. The department will review the documents. If they are accepted, you'll be asked to bring the instrument for inspection.
4. The department will inspect the instrument. If it's approved, you'll be called in for a discussion with the director.
5. If the documents or instrument don't meet the requirements, you'll be advised on what needs to be amended before resubmitting.

The pattern approval fees are as follows:

- Weights, measures, and bean scales, spring balances: LKR 1,000
