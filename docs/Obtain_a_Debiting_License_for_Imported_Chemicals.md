## Obtain a Debiting License for Imported Chemicals

If you are importing chemicals into Sri Lanka, you need to obtain a debiting license from the Department of Import and Export Control. This license allows you to legally import and debit the chemicals you bring into the country.

To get the debiting license, you must meet certain requirements and submit the necessary documents. This process ensures that the imported chemicals are properly accounted for and comply with Sri Lankan regulations.

## Important Information

- You must have a valid license to import chemicals.
- If your license has expired, you need to provide a letter explaining the delay and get approval for an extension.
- If you have violated the license conditions, you may need to pay an additional fee.

## Additional Information
