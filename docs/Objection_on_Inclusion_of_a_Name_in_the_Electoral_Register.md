## Objection on Inclusion of a Name in the Electoral Register

If you notice that someone's name has been included in the electoral register (the "A" List or "B" List) who you believe is not eligible for registration, you can submit an objection to have their name removed.

## Important Information

- You must submit the objection within 28 days during the month of November/December when the electoral registers are displayed for public inspection.
- There is no cost to submit an objection.
- If your objection is rejected, you can appeal to the District Judge within 10 days.

## What You Need

To submit an objection, you will need:

- Your National Identity Card
- Birth certificate of the person you are objecting to
- Declaration statement from the Grama Niladari (village officer) about the person's eligibility

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Check the "A" List and "B" List of registered voters displayed at the district office and post offices to identify the person you want to object to.
2. Obtain the "C" Form from the district office or post office to submit your objection.
3. Fill out the "C" Form and submit it to the Assistant Commissioner of Elections (at the district level), Registration Officer, or Grama Niladari.
4. You and the person you objected to will be called for an interview. Bring your supporting documents to prove your grounds for the objection.
5. The Assistant Commissioner of Elections or Registration Officer will make a decision on your objection.
6. If your objection is rejected, you can appeal to the District Judge within 10 days.
7. The District Judge will hold an inquiry and make the final decision. If the objection is accepted, the person's name will be removed from the electoral register.
